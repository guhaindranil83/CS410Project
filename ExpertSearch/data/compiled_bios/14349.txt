People Dr Sangeet Saha People Dr Sangeet Saha Senior Research Officer School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email sangeet.saha@essex.ac.uk Location Colchester Campus Profile Publications Contact Profile Publications Contact Profile Biography I am Senior Research Officer (PostDoc) at the Department of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex. I joined the institute in May, 2018. Previously, after submitting my PhD thesis in 2017, I worked briefly as a Visiting Scientist with the Advanced Computing and Micro-electronics Unit (ACMU), Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata, India. I have completed my PhD from University of Calcutta under the supervision of Dr. Amlan Chakrabarti, Dean, CU and Dr. Arnab Sarkar, Associate Prof., IIT Guwahati. Presently, I am working in National Centre for Nuclear Robotics (NCNR) (https://www.ncnr.org.uk/) project where I am mainly focusing on designing novel H/W, S/W techniques for real-time resilient embedded systems. I am also involved in INCASE Interreg project (https://www.incase2seas.eu/) where our primary focus remain to develop FPGA based solutions for industrial automotive communications.
