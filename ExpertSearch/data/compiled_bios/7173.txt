She earned the M.S and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2013 and 2016 respectively, focusing upon III-V semiconductor and MEMS devices and microsystems for RF applications. Prior to joining the ECE faculty at Georgia Tech, she was a postdoctoral scholar in the Physics Department at Caltech from 2016 to 2017. Dr. Ansari is the recipient of a 2017 ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award from the University of Michigan for her research on Gallium Nitride integrated microsystems for RF applications. She received the University of Michigan Richard and Eleanor Towner Prize for outstanding Ph.D. research in 2016. She is a member of IEEE, IEEE Sensors young professional committee and serves as a technical program committee member of IEEE IFCS 2018. Research interests: Nano/micro-electro-mechanical systems Resonant devices for timing, sensing, and RF applications Nonlinear and nonreciprocal devices CMOS and beyond-CMOS integrated microsystems III-V electro-acoustic devices, HEMTs, and circuits Distinctions: 2017 ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Award from the University of Michigan 2016 University of Michigan Richard and Eleanor Towner Prize Member, IEEE Member, IEEE Sensors Young Professional Committee Technical Program Committee Member, IEEE IFCS 2018 A.
