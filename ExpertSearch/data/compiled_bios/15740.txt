He was a Dissertation Research Fellow at the Institute for the Study of Human Flourishing there, and an inaugural member of the APA Graduate Student Council. His research interests include moral psychology, the history of ethics, early Chinese ethics, social epistemology, virtue ethics, and metaethics. Seths research focuses on ways in which non-normative information should constrain our normative theorizing. He has written about the intersection of social intelligence and virtue ethics as well as situationist psychology and moral development in the context of early Confucian ethics, and is currently working on epistemic injustice and rhetorical manipulation. Seth is one of the founders of The Deviant Philosopher, a web resource which helps philosophy instructors better include philosophy from outside the traditional canon in their teaching.
