This work involves graphical models using stochastic processes (discrete Markov processes or continuous diffusions), and developing tools for model selection, Bayesian inference, and new models that capture enough realism, but that remain computationally feasible in our Big Data era I also got interested in a number of various biological applications through statistical consulting across campus, like ecology, food science and veterinary science.
