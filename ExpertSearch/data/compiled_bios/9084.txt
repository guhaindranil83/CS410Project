In cyber-physical systems, beside forecasting and prediction tasks, machine learning techniques can be used in other applications such as anomaly detection, smart controller design, and surveillance systems. Furthermore, one of the important issues with machine learning and time series analytics is the existence of noise in datasets. Machine learning algorithms are sensitive to noise and hence, denosing is a crucial step to perform before using any machine learning algorithm. Current research problems that I am working on them are as follows: Real time techniques for time series denoising using information theory and deep learning Anomaly detection in cyber-physical systems in order to perform fault detection and fault location with the aim of reliability improvement Using open source datasets for forecasting applications in health science and tourism industry Wikipedia usage behavior modeling Computer Science 901 12th Avenue Seattle, WA 98122 (206) 296-5510 cs@seattleu.edu seattleu.edu People StudentsFaculty and StaffAlumniParents Essentials Online ProgramsDirectoriesGiveMySU Visit Campus ToursLibraryCampus MapGetting to SU Follow Us Apply Now Contact Careers Request Info Terms of Service Privacy PolicyEthics Line Website Feedback Sitemap Seattle University
