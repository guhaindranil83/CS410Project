Rincn-Mora has been a Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) since 2001, a Visiting Professor at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan since 2011, was Director of the Georgia Tech Analog Consortium from 2001-2004, Director of the TI Analog Fellowship Program from 2001-2015, an Adjunct Professor at Georgia Tech from 1999-2001, and IC Design Team Leader at Texas Instruments from 1994-2003. He is Fellow of the American National Academy of Inventors (NAI), Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) for contributions to power-conditioning and energy-harvesting microchips. He was inducted into Georgia Tech's Council of Outstanding Young Engineering Alumni and named one of "The 100 Most Influential Hispanics" by Hispanic Business magazine. Other distinctions include the National Hispanic in Technology Award from the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), Charles E. Perry Visionary Award from Florida International University (FIU), Three-Year Patent Award from Texas Instruments, Orgullo Hispano Award from Robins Air Force Base, Hispanic Heritage Award from Robins Air Force Base, Commendation Certificate from former Lieutenant Governor Cruz M. Bustamante of California, IEEE Service Award, and IEEE Distinguished Lecturer. His scholarly products include 9 books, 4 book chapters, 42 patents, over 170 articles, over 26 commercial power-chip designs, and over 130 international speaking engagements. Prof. Rincn-Mora's research is on the design and development of silicon-based microchips and microsystems that draw and condition power from tiny batteries, fuel cells, magnetically coupled coils, and generators that harness ambient energy from motion, light, temperature, and radiation to supply and sustain mobile, portable, and self-sustaining devices like wireless microsensors for biomedical, consumer, industrial, and military applications.
