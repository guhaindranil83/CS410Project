Shalek is a core faculty member of the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES), an Associate Professor of Chemistry, and an Extramural Member of The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. He is also an Associate Member of the Ragon Institute and an Institute Member of the Broad Institute, an Assistant in Immunology at MGH, and an Instructor in Health Sciences and Technology at HMS. His research is directed towards the development and application of new technologies that facilitate understanding of how cells collectively perform systems-level functions in healthy and diseased states. Alex received his bachelors degree summa cum laudefrom Columbia University and his PhD from Harvard University in chemical physics under the guidance ofHongkun Park. To date, his interdisciplinary research has focused on developing and utilizing nanoscale manipulation and measurement technologies to understand how small components (molecules, cells) drive systems of vast complexity (cellular responses, population behaviors). As a graduate student, Alex developed arrays of nanowires as cellular-scale syringes and electrochemical probes (Shalek et al,PNAS, 2010;Robinson et al,Nature Nanotechology, 2012) and used them to study how biochemical perturbations alter cellular responsesen masse(Chevrier et al,Cell, 2011;Shalek et al,Nano Letters, 2012;Yosef et al,Nature, 2013). While these studies yielded important insights, they also highlighted how population-level measurements can mask underlying differences between individual cells. In recognition of this, as a postdoctoral fellow, Alex developed an alternative approach that uses single-cell RNA-Seq to identify distinct cell states and circuits from the natural variation that exists between cells (Shalek et al,Nature, 2013). He then utilized microfluidic cell preparation and isolation schemes to discover how cell-to-cell variability in an immune response can arises from intra- and intercellular regulatory circuits (Shalek et al,Nature, 2014), and, as an independent investigator, helped realize massively parallel, reverse-emulsion- and nanowell-based strategies (Drop-Seq, Seq-Well, respectively) to explore the cellular composition of the retina (Macosko et al, Cell, 2015) and make single-cell RNA-Seq of low-input clinical specimens globally feasible (Gierahn et al, Nature Meth., 2017), respectively. In parallel, Alex and his team has leveraged these and additional approaches (Genshaft et al, Genome Biology, 2016; Kimmerling et al, Nature Commun., 2016) to help characterize the causes and consequences of cellular heterogeneity in additional systems of interest, such as cancer (Lohr et al,Nature Biotechnology, 2014;Patel et al,Science, 2014; Tirosh et al, Science, 2016), HIV-1 infection (Klverpris et al, Immunity, 2016; Ranasinghe et al, Immunity, 2016), and inflammation (Ordovas-Montanes et al, Nature, 2018; Smillie et al, Cell, 2019). degrees PhD in Chemical Physics, Harvard University, 2011 AM in Chemical Physics, Harvard University, 2006 BA in Chemical Physics, Columbia University, 2004 selected awards/societies Pew-Stewart Scholar, Pew Charitable Trust, 2018-2022 Alfred P.

To examine the rules that govern ensemble cellular behaviors, we employ a comprehensive, five-step approach: first, we identify the fundamental elements that comprise our systems; second, we decipher the salient characteristics that differentiate each element; third, we explore how environmental signals impact the molecular computations each element makes; fourth, we examine how direct interactions between elements influence each other; and, finally, we investigate how the foregoing factors cooperatively drive ensemble phenomena. At each step, as we face technical limitations and pressing biological needs, we develop and apply innovative methodologies to empower a deeper, more mechanistic inquiry. Our technology development leverages recent advances in genomics, chemical biology, and nanotechnology to establish cross-disciplinary platforms for in-depth profiling and precise manipulation of cells and their interactions. Examples include microdevices for massively-parallel single-cell genomics, strategies for simultaneously measuring diverse cellular variables, microfluidic tools for controlling the cellular microenvironment, and approaches for engineering and profiling cell-cell interactions. Our biological applications focus on the roles of cellular heterogeneity and cell-to-cell communication in driving immune responses. Current studies examine how: innate and adaptive immune cells coordinate balanced responses to environmental changes; host cell-pathogen interactions evolve across time and tissues during HIV-1 and M. Tuberculosis infection; and, tumor cells evade immune responses. Overall, our goal is to realize broadly-applicable experimental and computational platforms to uncover common cellular motifs that inform healthy and diseased immune responses. Using this information, we aim to help transform how the community thinks about single cells, cell-cell interactions, diseased tissues and processes, and therapeutics to create a new paradigm for understanding and designing systems-level multicellular behaviors. selected publications Smillie, C.#, Biton, M.#, Ordovas-Montanes, J.#, Sullivan, K., Burgin, G., Graham, D.B., Herbst, R.H., Rogel, N., Slyper, M., Walkman, J., Sud, M., Andrews, E., Haber, A.L., Vickovic, S., Dionne, D., Nguyen, L.T., Villani, A.C., Hofree, M., Creasey, E.A., Huang, H., Rozenblatt-Rosen, O., Garber, J.J., Khalili, H., Desch, A.N., Daly, M.J., Ananthakrishnan, A.N.*, Shalek, AK.*, Xavier, RJ.*, and Regev, A.*, Rewiring of the cellular and inter-cellular landscape of the human colon during ulcerative colitis, Cell, 178, 714 (2019).
