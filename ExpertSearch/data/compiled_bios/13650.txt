Dr. Potapenkos research interests include elasticity and composite materials. He studies the integral and functional equations of continuum mechanics, and also analyzes cosserate solids. His current research surrounds both fundamental and applied aspects of linear elasticity theories and the implementation of computational methods for the solution of boundary-value problems arising from those theories. In addition, he conducts research on traditional engineering areas such as plates and shells and on classical elasticity inclusion problems. Dr. Potapenko hires graduate students who are interested in conducting research in the areas of solid mechanics and elasticity. He also has several publications about elasticity, which is his predominant area of research.Research InterestsElasticityComposite MaterialsIntegral Equations of Continuum MechanicsFunctional Equations of Continuum MechanicsCosserat SolidsPlates and ShellsApplied mechanics and stochastic systemsStructuresMechanics & ConstructionEducation2002, Doctorate, PhD, Universitiy of Alberta2000, Master's, MSc, St. Petersburg State University1994, Bachelor's, BSc, St. Petersburg State UniversityCourses*CIVE 610 - ElasticityTaught in 2015, 2018, 2019CIVE 331 - Advanced Mathematics for Civil EngineersTaught in 2016, 2017ENVE 221 - Advanced CalculusTaught in 2015, 2016CIVE 224 - Probability and StatisticsTaught in 2016ENVE 223 - Differential Equations and Balance LawsTaught in 2015, 2016CIVE 105 - Mechanics 2Taught in 2017CIVE 222 - Differential EquationsTaught in 2017CIVE 205 - Solid Mechanics 2Taught in 2018, 2019CIVE 306 - Mechanics of Solids 3Taught in 2018, 2019CIVE 221 - Advanced CalculusTaught in 2018, 2019GEOE 221 - Advanced CalculusTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsAtroshchenko, E and Potapenko, S, Weak solutions of the transmission problem in anti-plane Cosserat elasticity, ZAMM-Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics/Zeitschrift fr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik, 2015Atroshchenko, Elena and Potapenko, S and Glinka, G, Stress intensity factor for a semi-elliptical crack subjected to an arbitrary mode I loading, Mathematics and Mechanics of Solids, 19(3), 2014, 289 - 298Kapiturova, Maria and Gracie, R and Potapenko, S, Simulation of cracks in a Cosserat medium using the extended finite element method, Mathematics and Mechanics of Solids, 2014Skiba, Oxana and Gracie, Robert and Potapenko, Stanislav, Electromechanical simulations of dislocations, Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering, 21(3), 2013Potapenko, Stanislav and Shmoylova, E, Weak solutions of the problem of torsion of micropolar elastic beams, Zeitschrift fr angewandte Mathematik und Physik, 61(3), 2010, 529 - 536 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
