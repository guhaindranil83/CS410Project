Current Students PhD:G. Kaveh Ahmadi MS:D. Shrestha Ujjwal, Zarean Zeinab Biography E. Salari received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Wayne State University in 1978 and 1982, respectively. He is at present a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Toledo, where he is involved in teaching and research in the areas of image analysis and computer vision, data compression for multimedia communication, neural networks, and signal processing. He has contributed extensively in several areas of image processing and neural networks including image and video compression, motion analysis, image representation, object recognition and application of neural networks to image enhancement and restoration. Dr. Salari worked as a research fellow at NASA Langley, Goddard and Lewis (Glenn) research centers during the summers of 1987, 1988, 1990 and 1991 on various image processing projects. He also served as graduate director of EECS Department from 2000-2005.
