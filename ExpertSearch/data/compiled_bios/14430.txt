We work together respectfully because we recognize that we have more impact when we join forces. We appreciate that we are in a learning institution and are not afraid to ask for assistance from our colleagues. Our customers, the Faculty and Students, always come first! We seek out the positive and even when we do not exactly agree, if the underlying idea is good, we work on it together. We are proud of the Chemistry Department and feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for all that it stands for.
