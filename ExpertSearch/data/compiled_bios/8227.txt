She also obtained another degree in industrial management from Lule University of Technology (M.S.) in Sweden. Rezaie received her doctorate (2013) in mechanical engineering from Clean Energy Research Lab at University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Canada. She proposed potential enhancement of district energy systems, developed a function to evaluate environmental and economic aspects of alternative energy technology for a district energy system by considering taxation and incentives, examined energy managements of district energy systems integrated with thermal energy storages, proposed grid configuration of multiple thermal energy storages, modeled and analyzed integrated district energy systems with multiple thermal energy storages to increase energy efficiency, developed a method to find right number of thermal energy storages for a district energy system, designed different scenarios of alternative energy technology for various buildings (residential, commercial and institutional). Prior to joining U of I, she was a lecturer and researcher as at University of Ontario Institute of Technology She also was a research associate at Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario where she worked on integrated renewable energy technologies for net zero energy community in London, Ontario, Canada. Rezaie also has extensive industrial experience in automotive industry in roles of quality assurance laboratories manager, quality engineer, manufacturing engineer, R&D engineer, and production manager; she has managed/developed/accredited six industrial quality assurance laboratories. She also launched several automotive projects for automakers like Toyota, Mazda and Chrysler. She managed industrial projects on time and budget. She is director in Professional Engineers of Ontario Chapter Executive (Lake Ontario Chapter).
