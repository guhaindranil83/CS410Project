In addition, he was editor-in-chief of its Journal of Business. He is the author of many scholarly articles and books, including Foundations of Econometrics and Prescriptions for Working Statisticians. He is also the coauthor of the Gastineau-Madansky model for stock option pricing and of the Edmundson-Madansky inequality used in stochastic linear programming. For his research in statistics, Madansky has been named a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and a fellow of the Econometric Society. He was also a 2005 recipient of the American Statistical Association Founders Award. His long career includes being a researcher at the RAND Corporation; senior vice president at the Interpublic Group of Companies; president of Dataplan, Inc.; and cofounder and vice president of The Analytical Group, Inc., a software development and data processing firm for the marketing research industry. His prior academic positions include terms as professor of mathematics and econometrics at UCLA, professor of marketing and econometrics at Yale, and chairman of the department of computer sciences at City College of New York. He has been a member of the board of trustees of Analytical Services, Inc., a not-for-profit firm providing consulting services primarily to the Department of Homeland Security and to the Department of Defense, as well as a consultant to the National Academy of Science and the RAND Corporation.
