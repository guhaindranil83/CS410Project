His family then relocated to Illinois when he was 10 and has stayed there ever since. Being an Illinois native, Xichen Jiang received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degree all in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. While a student there, Xichen has interned with Coilcraft, Proctor and Gamble, Exxon Mobil, and Viasat. His research interests include power system reliability and cyber-physical systems. In particular, his research applies statistical and set-theoretic methods to detect and mitigate attacks or faults on the power system network. Recently, his research involves characterizing uncertainty that results from the growing number of renewable resources penetrating into the existing power grid.Educational & Professional ExperiencePh.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering,University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, August2016.Research Interests Power System Reliability Fault Detection Event Detection Real-time Power System Health Monitoring Renewable Energy Integration Have more questions?
