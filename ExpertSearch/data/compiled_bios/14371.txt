Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Biography Welcome to my Essex page. (More details of my research: https://sites.google.com/site/zilongliu2357.) I am always looking for highly motivated students, visitors, and collaborators. Please don't hesitate to drop me an email if you are interested in my research. If you have obtained (or close to) a PhD and wish to work with me as a postdoc researcher, there are a number of excellent Fellowships that we may explore together: Newton International Fellowships (2 years, THE ROYAL SOCIETY), Research Fellowships in Science and Engineering from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 (3 years), Leverhume Trust Early Career Fellowship (3 years), EPSRC Postdoctoral Fellowships (3 years), Ernest Rutherford Fellowship (5 years), Rutherford International Fellowship Programme (2 years), and ERC Marie Curie Actions (2 years). My research lies in the interplay of coding, signal processing, and communications, with a major objective of bridging theory and practice as much as possible. I am extremely interested in attacking research problems that arise in practical communication and/or signal processing scenarios. Recently, I have developed an interest in applying AI and machine learning for enhanced communications and networking. From January 2018 to November 2019, I was a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), Home of the 5G Innovation Centre (5GIC), University of Surrey, focusing on air-interface design of 5G networks and beyond (e.g., machine-type communications, URLLC, 5G NR, V2X, NOMA). Prior to my career in UK, I spent 9.5 years in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, first as a Research Associate (Jul. 2008 to Oct. 2014) and then a Research Fellow (November 2014 to Dec. 2018). During my work in NTU, I participated in a number of advanced projects on design and prototyping of ultra-reliable communication systems. I received my PhD from NTU in June 2014 with a thesis entitled ``Perfect- and Quasi- Complementary Sequences" , advised by Prof Guan Yong Liang. My PhD thesis, focusing on the fundamental limits, algebraic constructions, and applications of complementary sequences in wireless communications, has settled a few long-standing open problems in the field. I was a Visiting PhD student to University of Melbourne (May 2012 to Feb. 2013, hosted by Prof Udaya Parampalli) and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Jun 2013 to Jul. 2013, hosted by Prof Wai Ho Mow). I received my MSc Degree from Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in Jul. 2007, with a thesis entitled "The Multistage Decoding Technique for DRM Receiver", advised by Prof Huazhong Yang. Trained to become a Digital IC Design Engineer, I played with communication system simulation and ASIC implementation during the MSc period. In Jun. 2004, I received Bachelor Degree from School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. I am an IEEE Senior Member and an Associate Editor of IEEE Access and Frontiers in Communications and Networks. Flexible, passionate, and determined, I am very open to engage with you to push forward the exciting forefront of the communication research.
