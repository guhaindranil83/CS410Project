I was originally an electronics engineer, but now my research interests make me more of a computer scientist and mathematician. For a more detailed biography see my personal web pages (link below). (See also:staff research interests by category) Qualifications PhD University of Reading, (1991) BSc (Hons) Electronic Engineering University of Southampton, (1979) Research and professional activities Research interests Colour image processing and vector signal processing Open to supervise Hypercomplex linear algebra and matrix decompositions with applications to vector signal and image processing Open to supervise Hypercomplex Fourier transforms and filters, vector filtering, filtering of orientation signals Open to supervise Current research I completed a book in 2014 about Quaternion Fourier Transforms in Signal and Image Processing with Dr Todd Ell in Minnesota, and Dr Nicolas Le Bihan in Grenoble.
