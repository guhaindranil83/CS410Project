His research interests are in modeling and characterizing wide bandgap semicondcutors for applications in next generation power electronics including renewable energy, electric aircraft and maritime systems, as well as low power consumer electronics. His research has been sponsored by the US Dept. of Defense and the US Dept. of Energy. He continues to publish his research in IEEE Transactions journals as well as other high-impact peer-reviewed venues. He also serves on the technical program committee for flagship international conferences in power conversion. For his presentation on the transient performance of silicon carbide MOSFETs, Raghav won a Technical Presentation Award at the 2013 Applied Power Electronics Conference in Long Beach California. Raghav also has significant industry experience, including a brief stint at HRL Laboratories LLC in Malibu California. There he was directly involved with the development of gallium nitride based battery chargers for electric vehicles. At UT, Raghav serves on the EECS Dept. Graduate Committee, the College of Engineering Diversity Committee and the College of Engineering Excecutive Committee which is an elected position. He is also the adviser for the student-chapter of IEEE. He teaches various courses in electronics, power conversion, and circuit analysis. He is a member of IEEE, Power Electronics Society, and Electron Devices Society. Recent Publications [1] M. R. Hontz, Y. Cao, M. Chen, R. Li, A. Garrido, R. Chu, and R.
