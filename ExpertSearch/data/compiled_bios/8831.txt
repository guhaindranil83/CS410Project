If you are affiliated with the business school, our trained lab staff can assist you with your study. Simply fill out a help request form, and we will be in touch within 24 to 48 hours. The lab has many resources to support and conduct your research, including lab spaces both on and off the Stanford GSB campus and online tools. You must contact the lab manager to receive training before you can access to these materials. New Resources Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) LIWC is an analysis software program that codes text for over 70 different dimensions, including positive/negative emotions, self-references, and causal words. Contact the lab for more information about this new resource. Stanford Digital Repository Stanford Libraries have developed this repository to serve as a long-term digital storage resource, available with persistent URLs, encrypted storage, and selectable/sharable files or folders. Use this as a place to house data for supporting journal article submissions. Qualtrics SMS Qualtrics SMS feature allows you to distribute short surveys to participants through text messages. Contact the lab for more information on how to use this feature. Lab Features RoomsThe Behavioral Lab has four interview rooms, five computer labs with several computer stations in each lab, one conference room, and two rooms that house Tobii eye-tracking computers. SoftwareBelow are the types of software that are currently in the lab. If your study requires other software licenses, let us know so that we can arrange for them to be purchased. Qualtrics is the labs web-based survey tool, which is extremely versatile and can be used to administer questionnaires either online or in-lab. The software enables you to incorporate pictures, audio, and video clips into your surveys. Qualtrics SMS allows researchers to quickly and easily reach participants by sending them short surveys through SMS. Contact the lab for more information about this. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is an analysis software program that codes text for over 70 different dimensions, including positive/negative emotions, self-references, and causal words. MATLAB is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. MediaLab is a versatile software package by Empirisoft that is available on all lab computers. DirectRT is Empirisofts reaction-time software, which is available on all lab computers. Inquisit, by Millisecond, is a web-based reaction-time program for which the lab has an account. E-Prime is a suite of applications that provides an easy-to-use environment for computerized experiment design, data collection, and analysis. FaceGen is a software that allows researchers to create realistic 3D human faces and heads. Researchers are able to adjust the faces for age, race, gender, and 150 other controls. This is available on one lab computer, please contact the lab for more information. Tobii Eye-TrackingThe Tobii eye-tracking suite includes the equipment and software necessary to track a participants eyes in the lab or in the field. Introductory Videos Conceptual Introduction to Eye Tracking Eye Tracking for Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis Eye-Tracking Experimental Design and Study Methodology Marketing, Market Research Applications Dynamic, Video Stimuli Scientific Research Pupil Dilation in Eye Tracking Scientific Research Analysis of Eye-Tracking Data of Variable Quality Scientific Research Face and Scene Perception Saliva Analysis TechnologyThe lab is capable of collecting and storing saliva (in a medical-grade freezer) for analysis. The saliva is sent to an off-site laboratory, where its components (e.g. cortisol, testosterone, progesterone)can be analyzed. Handgrip TechnologyThe lab has four Vernier Hand Dynamometerswhich can measure exerted forceon the handgrip over time to calculate grip strength, pinch strength, etc. Psychophysiology EquipmentWe own 2 BioNomadix Wireless Respiration & ECG amplifiers and 2 BioNomadix PPG and EDA amplifiers. They are capable of measuring respiration, electorcardiogram, blood volume pulse (BVP), and electrodermal activity (also known as Electrodermal Response, Skin Conductance Activity/Response, or Galvanic Skin Response). Participant Pools Foothill Community College Student PoolStudents at Foothill Community College are available for surveys through application to the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences on campus. Applications to use this population must be submitted prior to the academic quarter you wish to run your project. Harris Interactive Harris Interactive is a phone polling company. Mechanical TurkMechanical Turk is crowdsourcing platform run by Amazon that we use as a participant pool. Sona National PoolSona National Pool is open to potential participants who are 18 years and older and in the United States and Canada. Stanford Student PoolSona Stanford Student Poolis open to Stanford affiliates with a Stanford email address; though, most participants are undergraduates. Here, participants sign-up for either online studies or studies conducted in the lab. Survey MonkeySurvey Monkey has a three-million-person pool. Potential participants can be easily be restricted based on demographic criteria. Qualtrics PanelQualtrics Panelis a pool of participants managed by Qualtrics. You can sample randomly or targetparticipants with specific characteristics.
