Browne Clinical Professor of Law BA with distinction, University of Maine JD cum laude, Boston College Areas of Interest Civil Litigation, Legal Writing & Research, Trial Advocacy Contact Office Room 1302G Email cbrowne@bu.edu Phone 617-353-5819 Full CV Biography Constance Browne came to Boston University School of Law in 1982 as an instructor in the First-Year Writing Program and joined the full-time faculty of the clinical programs in 1989. As an associate professor in the Civil Litigation & Justice Program, she supervises students who represent clients in special education, unemployment, divorce, disability and housing cases. She also teaches courses in lawyering skills, helping students to develop and polish their interviewing, counseling, negotiating and trial advocacy abilities. In addition to teaching in the clinical program, Professor Browne offers an advanced writing and editing seminar and a seminar in trial advocacy. She helped initiate the Student Trial Team Program and served as a faculty advisor for the School of Laws Public Interest Law Journal from the publications inception until 1995. Before coming to Boston University, Professor Browne was in private civil litigation practice for seven years. Her publications include Absolute Veterans Preference in Public Employment: Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts et al. v. Feeney, and Title VII and the Equal Pay Act: Gunther v. County of Washington, both for the Boston College Law Review. Courses Advanced Legal Writing (S): LAW JD 874 3 credits The purpose of this seminar is to provide students with the opportunity to improve their writing, editing and communication skills. Students will prepare a variety of practice related documents based on a single fact pattern. Some legal research will be necessary, but the emphasis will be on writing, not on research. Students will also have the opportunity to edit other students' papers, with the goal of improving their own writing skills. Actors will perform a scenario for the class, from which students will extract the pertinent facts. From this fact pattern, students will draft an inter office memo, a letter or memo to a non lawyer client, and a trial or appellate brief. Students will also engage in simulated client interviewing and counseling sessions, as well as a simulated meeting with a supervisor. Students will be graded on the basis of their written work, editing work on their classmate's papers and on their classroom performance. There will be no final exam. NOTES: This class does not satisfy the upper-class writing requirement. This class counts toward the 6 credit Experiential Learning requirement. GRADING NOTICE: This class will not offer the CR/NC/H option. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 14 students. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who are on a wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.

Browne LAW 416 Effective & Ethical Depositions (S): LAW JD 958 3 credits The purpose of this seminar is to teach students how to take and defend effective and ethical depositions. The course involves both a simulated deposition component and a professional responsibility component. Simulated Deposition Course Component: Students will be divided into firms representing either the Plaintiff or the Defendants in a gender discrimination and defamation case brought by an attorney who has been denied partnership. The students will prepare and perform depositions of lay and expert witnesses and gather experience with obtaining and developing facts, preserving testimony, and the uses of depositions. Professional Responsibility Course Component: The simulated context offers the opportunity to explore several professional responsibility issues that arise naturally in deposition practice. These issues emerge largely because of the dual professional roles of an attorney: zealous representative and officer of the court. Some of the more timely issues involve proper witness preparation, improper witness coaching, inadvertent waiver of privilege, and abusive tactics. Writing and Performance Requirements: Each week students will write a short one or two page comment on the professional responsibility issues raised in class. At the end of the course, students will perform a videotaped deposition rather than take a final written exam. NOTE: This class may be used to satisfy the Professional Responsibility requirement, credits toward Experiential Learning requirement, or the upper-class writing requirement. This class may not be used to satisfy more than one requirement. ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 12 students per section. GRADING NOTICE: This class does not offer the CR/NC/H option. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar, or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, will be administratively dropped from the seminar. Students who wait list for a seminar are required to attend the first seminar meeting to be considered for enrollment.

When I am not working, I often will veg out with my family, read interesting articles, write, play Scrabble (which I never really played before), and try to clear my mind. Barriers that Bend but Dont Break Clara Burrill Bruce ('26) was the only African American woman in her class, and her election to chair of the Boston University Law Review was historic: she was the first woman to head the publication at BU and the first African American to become editor-in-chief of a law review anywhere in the country. Keeping His Eye on the Ball Four months before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Florida, Dan Malasky (01), chief legal officer for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was thinking about the possibility of a work stoppage.
