Dr. Ferri previously was the associate chair for Undergraduate Affairs in ECE and the associate chair for Graduate Affairs in ECE. She does research in embedded control systems and in engineering education. Dr. Ferri has received many honors and awards including the 2017 IEEE Undergraduate Teaching Award and the 2016 Regents Award for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. She is the co-chair of a campus-wide commission at Georgia Tech on the future of higher education, and she was an invited speaker at a National Academy of Engineering workshop on education. Dr. Ferri has been active with the IEEE Control Systems Society and served two terms on its Board of Governors. She was the program chair for the 1998 American Control Conference and will be the general chair for that conference in 2012. Dr. Ferri received the B.S degree in Electrical Engineering from Notre Dame and the M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton. She then worked for Honeywell for two years prior to returning to school to earn her Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Tech.
