His graduate work involved investigating the performance capabilities of an electrodynamic wheel for high-speed ground transportation applications. While at General Motors, Dr. Bird designed high torque density induction and interior permanent magnet motors for hybrid and fuel-cell vehicle applications. At Portland State University Dr. Bird has been continuing his research into the use of electrodynamic wheels as well as investigating the capabilities of magnetically geared electrical machines for wind and ocean power generation applications. Dr. Bird has authored or coauthored over 40 peer reviewed papers in major journals and conferences. Dr. Birds research has been funded by the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation,NASA and the North Carolina Coastal Studies Institute.
