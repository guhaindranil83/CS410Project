Prof. Sheffield is a probability theorist, working on geometrical questions that arise in such areas as statistical physics, game theory and metric spaces, as well as long-standing problems in percolation theory. A Sloan fellow and NSF Faculty CAREER awardee, Prof. Sheffield received the 2006 Rollo Davidson award for work on spatial models of probability theory and especially their relationship to stochastic (Schramm) Loewner evolutions. He received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2009. In 2011 he was selected for the Line and Michel Loeve International Prize in Probability, awarded by U.C. Berkeley every two years, to recognize outstanding contributions by researchers in probability who are under 45 years old. In 2014 he was awarded a Simons Fellowship in Mathematics.
