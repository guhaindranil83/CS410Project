(1967) Research Summary Dr. Rao's inter-disciplinary research and graduate education programs in environmental and ecological sciences/engineering have covered diverse research interests that have spanned from lab-scale, process-level studies, and network/systems modeling. Current research and educational interests are focused on: (1) landscape transitions under human impacts, including intensive food production and urbanization, (2) multi-scale modeling/analysis of hydrologic and biogeochemical responses of agricultural and urban catchments under natural and anthropogenic forcing; and (3) resilience analysis of coupled, complex (natural, engineered, social) systems, including inter- dependence of infrastructure networks and systems. Past projects have involved development and use of models for research purposes and for decision making, with applications in catchment-scale water-quality analyses; aquifer-scale studies on industrial land uses & assessments; groundwater vulnerability, contaminated site remediation, and watershed management. Selected Research Projects Resilience of inter-dependent urban infrastructure networks (water, transportation, electricity systems) Linking hydro-climatic forcing, bathymetry, hydrologic variability of wetlands and vegetation ecological adaptation Multi-scale catchment modeling of coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in intensely managed landscapes and river networks Selected Publications Complete listing available on Google Scholar Our People CE People Faculty Directory Staff Directory Administration Committees Alumni & Friends CE Ambassadors Student Spotlights Student Organizations Discover Students Online Faculty Alumni Partners Explore Campus Map Facts & Figures Schools News & Events Visit Us Connect Employment Engineering Computer Network Intranet Brightspace myPurdue People Engineering Directory Contact Us Social Media Media Contacts Purdue Directory Follow Purdue University, 610 Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, 765-494-4600 2020 Purdue University | An equal access/equal opportunity university | Integrity Statement | Copyright Complaints | Brand Toolkit | Maintained by the Engineering Computer Network Contact Office of Marketing and Media for accessibility issues with this page | Accessibility Resources | Contact Us | Email webmaster-ce@ecn.purdue.edu to report a problem
