He is affiliated with ASCE: Environmental & Water Resources Engineering, CWRA and River Restoration Northwest. His research interests lie in river engineering, understanding the effect of urbanisation on sediment transport, studying the hydrodynamics of straight pools, and quantifying wood transport in rivers. Professor MacVicar conducts research on hydraulic engineering and fluvial geomorphology, while placing a particular emphasis on river dynamics. His research uses field measurements, physical experiments and computer simulations to understand various aspects of river processes such as sediment transport and flow turbulence. He ultimately aims to improve engineering designs, protect and restore critical habitats in rivers and floodplains, and preserve the integrity of these complex systems. In addition to his research work, Professor MacVicar recruits graduate students for a field and GIS project in Toronto, where their potential funding is available through an NSERC IPS grant with an excellent mid-size firm specializing in river geomorphology and restoration. He also recruited graduate students for a laboratory-based project on sediment transport over complex boundaries using a new experimental channel that was constructed in 2012. Professor MacVicar has published several journals, and has also taken part in numerous global conference presentations.Research InterestsRiversSediment transportTurbulenceFloodsComplex systemsWood jamsPool-riffle bedformsStream restorationNatural channel designEco-hydraulicsRiver engineeringFluvial geomorphologyUrban stormwater managementEducation2006, Doctorate, Fluvial Geomorphology, University of Michigan1999, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of British Columbia1996, Bachelor of Applied Science, Water Resources Engineering, University of GuelphCourses*CIVE 381 - HydraulicsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017ENVE 398 - SeminarTaught in 2015GEOE 398 - SeminarTaught in 2015ENVE 214 - Fluid Mechanics and Thermal SciencesTaught in 2016ENVE 498 - SeminarTaught in 2016GEOE 498 - SeminarTaught in 2016CIVE 382 - Hydrology and Open Channel FlowTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019ENVE 280 - Fluid MechanicsTaught in 2018, 2019CIVE 770 - Topics in Environmental EngineeringTaught in 2018CIVE 682 - Free Surface HydraulicsTaught in 2016, 2018* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMacVicar, BJ, Good, bad and the ugly: Seasonal filtering and Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models for detecting and replacing spikes in velocimetric profile data, River Flow 2016: Iowa City, USA, July 11-14, 2016, 2016MacVicar, Bruce and Chapuis, Margot and Buckrell, Emma and Roy, Andr, Assessing the Performance of In-Stream Restoration Projects Using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Transponders, Water, 7(10), 2015, 5566 - 5591MacVicar, Bruce and Obach, Lana, Shear Stress and Hydrodynamic Recovery over Bedforms of Different Lengths in a Straight Channel, Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 141(11), 2015Chapuis, Margot and Bright, Christina J and Hufnagel, John and MacVicar, Bruce, Detection ranges and uncertainty of passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) transponders for sediment tracking in gravel rivers and coastal environments, Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 39(15), 2014, 2109 - 2120MacVicar, Bruce and Dilling, Scott and Lacey, Jay, Multi-instrument turbulence toolbox (MITT): Open-source MATLAB algorithms for the analysis of high-frequency flow velocity time series datasets, Computers & Geosciences, 73, 2014, 88 - 98 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
