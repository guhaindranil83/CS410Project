He enjoys studying systems with interesting dynamical behavior and applying the resulting knowledge to robotic systems such as legged robots and robotic exoskeletons. In particular, he seeks to understand the underlying dynamics and the relationships among different gaits and apply the insights to legged systems to achieve more robust and agile motions. His previous work approaches these goals by exploring the passive dynamic motions of a range of unified models in which motion patterns are approximated by purely mechanical oscillations of point masses and springs. Through a numerical continuation of periodic motions, it shows that a wide range of gaits emerge from a simple bouncing-in-place motion starting with different footfall patterns.
