These non-uniformities can be due to heat-transfer, compressibility or additives, for example, with applications to the development of high-speed vehicles, environmental or biomedical flows. Previous work has primarily focused on the examination of high-speed/hypersonic turbulent flows and the stratified atmosphere.OwenWilliams was born and educated in Toronto, Canada before moving to England to complete his Masters in Engineering from Imperial College, London. He obtained his PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Princeton University, experimentally examining the effects of compressibility and stratification on wall-bounded turbulence. Before joining the University of Washingtonhe was a Research Associate at the University of Maryland, computationally examining turbulent scaling theories for hypersonic turbulent flows as well as shock boundary layer interactions.
