He was the director of the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems from 1981 to 1999 and director of the Center for Intelligent Control Systems, an inter-university (Brown-Harvard-MIT) center for research on the foundations of intelligent systems from 1986-2000. Prof. Mitters research has spanned the broad areas of systems, communication, and control. Although his primary contributions have been on the theoretical foundations of the field, he has also contributed to significant engineering applications, notably in the control of interconnected power systems and pattern recognition. His current research interests are theory of stochastic and adaptive control; mathematical physics and its relationship to system theory; image analysis and computer vision; and structure, function and organization of complex systems.
