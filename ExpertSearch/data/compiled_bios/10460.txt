Ltd., Seoul, Korea, 2002-2005 Research Statement Dr. SungWoo Nams research program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) pursues innovations in controlled deformation (i.e., architecturing) of atomically-thin, two-dimensional (2D) materials to explore how unique shapes of atomically-thin materials enable new functionalities. In particular, his research group studies mechanical self-assembly of folded and crumpled graphene and two-dimensional materials for strain-tolerant and flexible/stretchable forms of sensors for biotic and abiotic investigations.
