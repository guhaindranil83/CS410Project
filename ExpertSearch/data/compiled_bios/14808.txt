Our research objective is multifold: to engage in applied research with industry and government collaborators; to involve and educate undergraduate and graduate students in the frontiers of mechanical engineering; and to satisfy the needs of Silicon Valley businesses and industries in this era of rapid technological advances. Potential research sponsors should contact faculty with the relevant expertise directly, or the department chair. The areas of research undertaken by our faculty are diverse and ever-changing. For the latest information, please go directly to the websites of individual faculty members. Electronic paper display technology developed by Professor John Lee and Zikon, Inc.read more Professor Winncy Du with pipe-inspecting robot. Developing a reliable way to inspect utility pipestransporting water, fuel, waste, or cablesfor damage is critical. Scaled model of parabolic trough used for solar energy concentration, installed in wind tunnel. A force balance (not shown) is used to measure wind drag forces on the concentrator and supporting structures. Rack-and-pinion mechanism in SU-8 polymer by ultrathick photolithography. The rack moves linearly in guided channels to turn the pinion. The moving parts were released by dissolving a thinner layer of lift-of-resist underneath the structural SU-8 layer.
