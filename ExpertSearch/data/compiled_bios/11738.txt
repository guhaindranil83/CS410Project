I am particularly interested in analysis on metric spaces including the theory of Sobolev spaces on metric spaces. Recently I am working in the theory of Sobolev mappings between manifolds and metric spaces. This includes questions about density of smooth and Lipschitz mappings with connection topology of spaces and also regularity theory for p-harmonic mappings between manifolds.
