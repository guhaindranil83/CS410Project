Faculty affiliated with the area are worldwide leaders in scholarship and in their contributions to accounting pedagogy. They also help shape accounting practices in the United States and elsewhere as a result of their influence in the standard-setting process.

The design of performance measurement and incentive systems. Best practices in corporate governance and executive compensation. Faculty in the area teach in the MBA, Stanford MSx, Executive Education, and PhD programs, with courses focusing on two broad areas: financial reporting and management control. Beyond the core MBA classes, a wide variety of electives cover topics in global financial reporting, financial statement analysis, and accounting-based valuation techniques.
