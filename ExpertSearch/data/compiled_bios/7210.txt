Peterson was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. He received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 1982, 1983, and 1986 respectively. He remained as Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois until 1989. Since 1989, he has been a member of the faculty of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he is now a full Professor. He teaches electromagnetic field theory, antennas, electromagnetic compatibility, and computational electromagnetics.
