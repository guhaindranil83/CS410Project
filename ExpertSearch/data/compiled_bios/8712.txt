Bucklin Peter W. Mullin Chair in Management, Professor of Marketing I believe that well make better decisions allocating resources if we understand markets at the individual level. randy.bucklin@anderson.ucla.edu (310) 825-7339 Areas of Expertise: Choice Models E-Commerce Internet Marketing Pricing and Promotion Sales and Channel Management About Biography Publications Biography Studying markets at the level of the individual consumer has been Professor Randy Bucklins passion since he earned his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1989. His work is designed to aid companies as they make a wide range of marketing decisions, including pricing, advertising, promotions and sales channels. The critical thing is to understand marketing data at a rich and granular level, says Bucklin. From there, you can aggregate to any level you like. Bucklins award-winning work has advanced with the times. Originally, his research looked at data culled from bar codes and focused on consumer packaged goods. Today, his quest to understand consumer choice behavior focuses on Internet marketing and advertising. He now utilizes clickstream data sources that track the browsing and purchasing behavior of consumers on the Web in real time. The impact of his recent work has been highlighted by winning the 2015 and 2016 William F. ODell Award, a very prestigious prize that recognizes articles with the greatest long-run impact in marketing. A versatile instructor, Bucklin has taught a variety of marketing courses at Anderson, including the required core course, sales and channel management, and price policies. I consider teaching a special role that allows me to pass knowledge on to my students, says Bucklin, who has received five teaching awards since joining the school. Its a real privilege to have as much of an impact as you can. Throughout his career, Bucklin has made numerous contributions to his field. These include co-editing the Journal of Marketing Research (20142016), co-editing Marketing Letters (20062010), co-chairing the INFORMS Marketing Science Conference in 2000 and co-chairing the Marketing Dynamics Conference in 2006. As a UCLA Anderson faculty member, his administrative service has included serving as faculty chairman and deputy dean from 2012 to 2015, serving two terms as marketing area chair and serving as chair of Andersons MBA Curriculum Committee from 2001 to 2004.
