His interests range across substances (e.g., from cigarette smoking to opioids) and across the lifespan (e.g., from prenatal drug exposure to medication treatment for ADHD in adults). Much of his current research examines pain and its treatment with opioid medications, using longitudinal health data on individuals and families and methods from epidemiology and behavioral genetics. As a licensed psychologist, Dr. Quinn is also broadly interested in other topics in mental health. Complete Bibliography Google Scholar Profile Selected PublicationsArticlesQuinn, P. D., Fine, K.
