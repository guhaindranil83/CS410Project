She has proposed a dynamically reconfigurable model composed of pipelined optical buses and developed a number of efficient algorithms for the model, including some for molecular dynamics simulation and image processing. She is currently working on issues for wireless sensor networks. These networks have a wide range of applications such as industrial and commercial control and monitoring, military, automotive sensing, health care, and precision agriculture. The nodes in the network coordinate to perform a common task, so the problem of energy waste can cause node failure and eventually make the whole network unusable because of network partition. To address these issues, she is studying methods to extend the lifetime for wireless sensor networks. This includes developing energy efficient protocols, optimizing the utilization of resources available, and investigating techniques to defend against malicious attacks. Publications M. Valero, R. A.
