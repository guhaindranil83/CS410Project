His expertise lies in the development of wide bandgap semiconductor and electronic devices. His researchopens the field of amorphous oxide semiconductor based thin-film transistor technology and significantly contributes to the advancement of oxide electronics. One key objective of his current research is to develop new amorphous oxide semiconductor materials and high-performance electronic devices for next generation wearable electronics, such as display and sensor applications. His group also has interest in advanced oxide-based nanostructured electronic devices. His research group works on a variety of aspects from material design, syntheses, film growth to device modeling, fabrication and testing based on theoretical and experimental approaches. His research aims to further develop oxide semiconductor device technology based on novel material development. Capsule Bio:Kenji Nomura received his Ph.D. degreein Material science engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech), Japan, in 2004. Afterwards, he wasa post-doctoral researcher in Material science laboratory, Tokyo Tech. He became an Associate Professor in the Frontier research center at Tokyo Techin 2010. He developed a key semiconductor material and invented high-performance oxide-TFTs. He worked at Qualcomm Inc as a principal engineer from 2012-2017. He has led multiple semiconductor material development projects. In 2018, he joined the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of CaliforniaSan Diego as a faculty member inthe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
