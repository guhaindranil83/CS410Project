Goyne Associate ProfessorDirector of the UVA Aerospace Research Laboratory Home Find Faculty Christopher P. Goyne Bio B.Eng. Mechanical Engineering, University of Queensland, 1991Ph.D. Mechanical Engineering, University of Queensland, 1999 "Oh, that view is tremendous" John Glenn aboard spacecraft Friendship 7, Feb. 20, 1962. Professor Goyne obtained his Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering and Ph.D. from the University of Queensland in 1991 and 1999, respectively. In the course of his Ph.D. research,Goyne specialized in high speed aerodynamics, high speed air-breathing propulsion and instrumentation development. Upon completion of his graduate studies, Goynejoined the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Virginia as a Research Associate. Here he conducted research in hypersonic propulsion using the University of Virginias unique Supersonic Combustion Facility. This work was funded by NASAs Hyper-X Program. He briefly returned to the University of Queensland to participate in the HyShot scramjet flight test program before joining the faculty at the University of Virginia. Now an Associate Professor and Director of the Aerospace Research Laboratory, he continues his work in hypersonic air-breathing propulsion, supersonic aerodynamics, hypersonic ground and flight test techniques and diagnostic and measurement technique development.Goyne also conducts research on the interaction of fluids with rotating machineryin collaboration with the Rotating Machinery and Controls (ROMAC) Industrial Program at the University of Virginia. Goyne is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and within this organization is past Chair of the Hypersonic Technology and Aerospace Planes Program Committee. He is also a member of the Aerodynamic Measurement Technology Technical Committee within AIAA and is a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.Hehas reviewed numerous manuscripts for the AIAA Journal, the Journal of Propulsion and Power, the Journal of Aircraft, Experiments in Fluids and the Journal of Aerospace Engineering. He has chaired various sessions at international aerospace conferences and participated in a number of invited panels and lectures. Goyne is currently the Faculty Advisor for the University of Virginia student chapters of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and also Sigma Gama Tau.
