Mohr Professor Academic Degrees Ph.D., 1981 University of Illinois Urbana, IL M.S., 1980 University of Illinois Urbana, IL B.S., 1978 University of Illinois Urbana, IL Areas of Research and Professional Interest Thin Film Deposition including sputtering and PECVD High Density Plasma Processing Nanoscale processing In-situ optical process monitroing In the News: Powered by the Sep 08, 2014: Team to prepare power-generating material for space flight, security About Natale Ianno Since joining the faculty in 1981, he has established an extensive research program in Thin Film Material Deposition and Processing. This work has included Pulsed Laser Deposition of a variety of materials, the sputter deposition of piezoelectric, optical and tribological thin films. He also has been involved in high density plasma etching of silicon and germanium. Recently, he has been developing and employing hollow cathode jet plasma jet deposition to grow unique, metastable column IV semiconductor alloys. Selected Publications J. S. Schrader. J. L.
