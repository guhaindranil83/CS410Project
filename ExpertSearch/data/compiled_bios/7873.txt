He began his adventures in polymer science as a high school student under Prof. Miriam Rafailovich at SUNY Stony Brook. After completing a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell in 2006, he moved to The University of Michigan and earned a Ph.D. in Macromolecular Science & Engineering, under the mentorship of Kenichi Kuroda, in 2011. Ed was also an NSF/JSPS visiting scholar at Nagoya University under Prof. Masami Kamigaito in 2010. Following a postdoc with Anne McNeil in Chemistry at Michigan, Ed joined the faculty at RPI in 2014. Awards and Honors:: ACS PMSE Young Investigator, 2018 NSF CAREER Award, DMR-Biomaterials, 2017 ACS PRF Doctoral New Investigator Award, 2017 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award, 2016-2018 Education Ph.D. Macromolecular Science & Engineering (2011), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI B.S.
