Faculty Hiroshi Ishikawa , MD Professor of Ophthalmology and Biomedical Engineering Biomedical Engineering I am the director of the Ocular Imaging Center at NYU Langone Eye Center. My research focuses on developing and applying new signal/image processing techniques to denoise, enhance, segment, and analyze various aspects of clinical imaging outcomes. We aim to explore and establish comprehensive and cohesive relationships between image-based analysis and real-life clinical findings. I have over 23 years of experience in structural, metabolic, and functional imaging research of the eye in humans and animal models of glaucoma and other visual impairments. I completed medical school at Mie University School of Medicine (Mie, Japan) in 1989. After completion of glaucoma fellowship in Japan, I became a glaucoma research fellow under Dr. Robert Ritch at New York Eye & Ear Infirmary. I won The David Warfield Fellowship in Ophthalmology of The New York Community Trust and The New York Academy of Medicine in 1997. I was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at New York Medical College in 1998, at Tufts University in 2002, and at the University of Pittsburgh in 2003. I am currently Professor of Ophthalmology at New York University. My research yielded 19 intellectual properties; 9 US patents allowed, 2 US patents pending, and 8 copyrights. I am recognized as the first inventor of the detailed macular retinal layer segmentation of OCT images. Ongoing research projects: Deep Learning Approaches for Personalized Modeling and Forecasting of Glaucomatous Changes Developing prediction models of the complicated glaucoma progression using feature agnostic deep learning approaches. OCT Image Atlas Building Developing a method to generate OCT image atlas (normalized group template of OCT images) in order to analyze morphological deformation of the human retina under various conditions. In vivo Oxygen Saturation Measurements Using Visible Light OCT Developing a method to measure oxygen saturation level within retinal blood vessels in vivo, which may lead to new biomarkers for various ocular pathologies. Research Interests: Biomedical imaging, Optical coherence tomography (OCT), Artificial intelligence, Deep learning, Visual system, Eye, Glaucoma, Signal and image processing Email Hiroshi.Ishikawa [at] nyulangone.org Phone 929-455-5508 Website School of Medicine profile Office NYU Langone Eye Center Main Menu NYU Tandon Made in Brooklyn Quick Links NYU Libraries NYU Classes NYU Albert Accessibility Bulletin Directory Login (Faculty & Staff) Information For Students Faculty Staff Alumni Parents Industry Media Careers at Tandon Contact Contact Us 646-997-3600 NYU Campuses New York Shanghai Abu Dhabi NYU Tandon Made in Brooklyn Make a Gift Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube LinkedIn NYU Tandon 2020
