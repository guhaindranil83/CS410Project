Economou Prize Research Description:Our research focuses on the synthesis, characterization, engineering, and simulation of nanostructured materials and systems for photonics, energy, and chemical conversion applications. We seek to understand how size, morphology, organization, and surface structure affect the physicochemical properties and behavior of materials over different length, time, and energy scales. Interest areas include: III-nitride nanostructures, micro/nano-LEDs Near-field optical microscopy & plasmonics Bio-inspired photonics Micro- and atmospheric pressure plasmas (mat'l synthesis and spectroscopy) Light-matter interactions & spectroscopy Energy storage, magnetic, and catalytic materials Education:BS:Chemical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines (1994)MS:Chemical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines (1995)MS:Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology (1998)PhD:Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology (2003) Related News July 23, 2019 ChE's Summer 2019 E-Newsletter is Out!
