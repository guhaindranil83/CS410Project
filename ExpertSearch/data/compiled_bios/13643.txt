His research is centered on the analysis, design and optimization of steel structures. Professor Xus goal is to develop theoretical advances and practical innovations. The primary method of his research consists of analytic development, numerical computation and experimental testing. His principal areas of research are the analysis and design of cold-formed steel structures, and the performance-based seismic analysis and design of steel buildings. The main objectives of the former are to develop innovative designs and structural products, and to promote advanced techniques for the Canadian construction industry. Professor Xu is currently working on vibration control for lightweight cold-formed steel floor systems, and seismic and fire performance of cold-formed steel structures. Pertaining to the performance-based seismic analysis and design of steel buildings, he is working on the stability analysis and design of steel building structures, while accounting for any conventional and extreme circumstances that they may experience during their lifetime. Professor Xu actively involved in the development of engineering standards on cold formed steel structures. He is a member of the Canadian Standards Association and serves for Technical Committees (CSA-S136) on Cold Formed Steel Structural Members, (CSA-G401) on Corrugated Steel Pipe Products, and (CSA-A660) on Certification of Manufactures of Steel Building Systems. He also sits on several International Standards Committees such as the American Iron and Steel Institute: Technical Committee for Standards on Steel Framing; the Chinese Construction Industrial Standard Committees (JG/T 182) on Steel Members of Assembled Residential Buildings with Light-Weight Steel Framing, and (JGJ/T XXX) on Technical Specification for Cold-Formed Thin-Walled Steel Multi-Storey Residential Buildings.Research InterestsPerformance-based Structural Analysis and designDesign and Optimization for Cold-formed SteelDesign and Optimization for Hot-Rolled SteelStructural Steel ConnectionsOptimization MethodsSteel and concrete structuresStructuresMechanics & ConstructionStability analysisdesign and optimization of steel framed structuresPerformance-based seismic analysis and design of building structuresFire performance of steel framed structures and cold-formed steel structuresVibration performance of lightweight floor systemsDigital design and fabrication technologiesEnvironmental issuesnew material economiesLightweight materialsSmart buildingsEducation1995, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Toronto1982, Bachelor of Engineering, Civil Engineering, Chongqing Institute of Architecture & EngineeringCourses*CIVE 398 - SeminarTaught in 2015CIVE 399 - SeminarTaught in 2015CIVE 401 - Civil Engineering Design Project 2Taught in 2015, 2016CIVE 303 - Structural AnalysisTaught in 2017CIVE 604 - Advanced Structural Steel DesignTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CIVE 310 - Introduction to Structural DesignTaught in 2018, 2019CIVE 413 - Structural Steel DesignTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsXu, L and Yuan, XL, A simplified seismic design approach for mid-rise buildings with vertical combination of framing systems, Engineering Structures, 99, 2015, 568 - 581Xu, L and Zhuang, Y, Storey stability of unbraced steel frames subjected to non-uniform elevated temperature distribution, Engineering Structures, 62, 2014, 164 - 173Zhuang, Y and Xu, L, Elastic Buckling Strengths of Unbraced Steel Frames Subjected to Variable Loadings, Advances in Structural Engineering, 16(5), 2013, 947 - 958Xu, L and Zhuang, Y, Storey-based stability of unbraced steel frames at elevated temperature, Journal of Constructional Steel Research, 78, 2012, 79 - 87 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
