I have done work on eigenvlaue and singular value inequalities of matrices, and quaternionic matrices. Then, I get interested in graphs, i.e., dots and lines. In particular, I apply spectral techniques to study graphs via adjacency matrices. Lately, I learn about probability, i.e., chances. Probabilistic methods are powerful tools in studying matrices and graphs.
