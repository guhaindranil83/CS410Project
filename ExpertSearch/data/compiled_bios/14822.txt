At Santa Clara, Dr. Fabris has co-developed the microscale boiling laboratory to study high-speed nucleation and bubble growth processes, and spray cooling mechanisms. Dr. Fabris has also been active on the Thermal and Electron Nanoscale Transport project testing thermal interface materials and developing non-contact reflectance-based temperature measurement techniques for thin film and carbon nanostructure conductivity measurements. He is also working on the development of spectral element techniques for modeling. He has organized national workshops in direct liquid cooling (2006), a forum on energy use and policy (2001), and was invited to the Japan-America Frontiers of Engineering (2007) organized by the National Academy of Engineering. Dr. Fabris has over 60 refereed publications, $3.9M in total funding (PI and Co-PI), and has received NSF support for education and curriculum development.
