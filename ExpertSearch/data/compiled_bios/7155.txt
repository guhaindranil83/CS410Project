During the summer of 2004, he was with Guidant Corporation (later acquired by Boston Scientific), working on accelerometer systems for implantable biomedical devices. In 2010, he joined Intel Corporation. His work at Intel included the next-generation energy-efficient mm-Wave communication link and broadband CMOS Font-End-Modules for Wi-Fi systems. In May 2011, he joined Skyworks Solutions, where he led the development of SAW-less integrated filter solutions for low-cost cellular-standard power amplifier Front-End-Modules. In spring 2012, he joined the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology as an assistant professor. Dr. Wang is generally interested in innovating and engineering mixed-signal, RF, and mm-Wave integrated systems for wireless communication and bioelectronics applications. He is a member of Sigma Xi, the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society, and the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society. Research interests: Broadband and energy-efficient RF/mm-Wave integrated circuits and systems Self-healing integrated systems for communication, radar, and biosensing Sub-TeraHz system integration for spectroscopy and imaging Hand-held Point-of-Care (PoC) sensing platforms for biomedical and environmental applications Fundamental noise modeling in high-precision measurements Distinctions: IEEE RFIC 2012 Technical Program Committee (TPC) Member 46th DAC/ISSCC Student Design Contest Winner, 2009 Conference Session Chair (Invited), Special Session on ASIC Sensors for Biomedical and Environmental Applications, the 54th IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, Seoul, South Korea, 2011 Workshop Session Chair (invited), Wireless Session, CMOS Emerging Technology Workshop, Whistler, Canada, 2011 Caltech Innovation Initiative (CI2) Research Grant, 2008-2010 H.
