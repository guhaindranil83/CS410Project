Trauma accounts for nearly 10% of global deaths, of which 90% occur in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most devastating, both in terms of mortality, but also in terms of the long-term implications to both the patient and their family.1,2 Caring for theTBIpatient is a complex task, involving a number of different heath system elements: pre-hospital care, emergency medicine,anaesthesia, surgery, intensive care, physiotherapy, and rehabilitation. These elements are inter-dependent, and improving one area may not show a measurable benefit without concomitant improvement in the others. Furthermore,TBIcare is context-specific with lessons from one setting not easily translating to a new environment. This variation does not simply apply to the technical expertise required but to the fundamental questions if what constitutes an acceptable final outcome.3 Healthcare is the emergent property of asociotechnicalsystem consisting of people, processes, information, equipment, consumables, infrastructure, culture, finance, and governance. To improve the overall care ofTBIpatients, we need to understand how these come together how these deliver the existing system of care, and how specific interventions might work toreengineerthem to provide the desired system of care. This requires a health systems approach. Systems thinking is championed in healthcare by the World HealthOrganisation(WHO), the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), and many others. The WHO specifically recommend its place inLMIChealthcare improvement given the complexity of this undertaking.46In consideringTBI, the need for a systems approach is also advocated by both the Lancet Commission for Global Surgery and the Lancet Neurology Commission on TBI.7,8However, there are few examples of a systems approach being applied toTBIcare inLMICs. A new position document published by the UK Royal Academy of Engineering in partnership with the Royal College of Physicians and the Academy of Medical Sciences has demonstrated the value that the Engineering community can add to the understanding and improvement of complex healthcare systems.9We have established a partnership between clinical academics in the UK and Myanmar with an interest inNeurotrauma, alongside the Healthcare Design Group, based in the Engineering Design Centre, Cambridge. This partnership is seeking to use tools from the engineering community to understand the current service aroundTBIcare in Myanmar, and to understand how interventions may be designed to improve this service. The project is beginning with a qualitative exploration of the current experiences ofTBIin Myanmar through a variety of stakeholders. This will be performed through facilitated interviews conducted by our partner researchers in Myanmar, and seek to explore some core questions relating to the provision ofTBIcare: Who are the stakeholders? Where is the system ofTBIcare situated? What are its elements? How does the system perform? Using this data we will then seek to develop consensus models which can help describe the current system ofTBIcare in Myanmar and inform the design of a series of interventions to improveTBIcare which are context-dependent, and consistent both with each other and with the wider heath system. Fundamental to this approach is that it is context-specific: carried out by Myanmar researchers and seeking to explore the perspectives of not only clinicians but also clinical managers, patients and the public.

BiographyEmail:tb508@cam.ac.uk ORCiD: 0000-0003-0228-9779 Previously an NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow in theUDA, Tom is a Clinical Research Fellow funded by theNIHR Global Health Research Group on Neurotrauma,and a Specialist Registrar in Anaesthesia at Addenbrookes Hospital. His academic interest is in developing a systems understanding of interventions to improve anaesthetic care in low income settings, and he is currently registered as a PhD student working within the UDAHealth Systems Engineering Groupand theHealthcare Design Groupin the Department of Engineering. This is supported by aWD Armstrong Studentshipfrom the University of Cambridge School of Technology, and involvessystems mapping of traumatic brain injury care in Myanmar. Toms introduction to global health came withVSOin Ethiopia between 2011-2012, during which time he worked closely withLifebox Foundation, and for which he was awarded theAAGBI/MPS Patient Safety Prize. He has worked in Myanmar with theCambridge-Yangon Trauma Intervention Projectsince 2013, and sits on the Advisory Committee ofCambridge Global Health Partnerships. He teaches on theMSc in Global Health with Surgery & Anaesthesia at Kings College London, and teaches both global health and health systems design to medical students at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine. Tom is the current President of theWorld Anaesthesia Society,the Specialist Society for UK anaesthetists interested in global health, and an Honorary Advisor to theTropical Health and Education Trust (THET).
