Honors and Awards Young Faculty Award, DARPA, 2012 CAREER Award , National Science Foundation, 2009 Faculty Type Tenured and Tenure-Track Related News Breakthrough Calorimeter Tool Gives Closer Look at Cell Growth07/06/2020 Two graduate students develop a new calorimeter tool that increases the measurement sensitivity of metabolic heat output ten-fold. Exploring a Novel, Nanoscale Thermal Switch02/12/2020 ME Professors Edgar Meyhofer and Pramod Reddyhave shown for the first time how a nanoscale thermal switch can be built by employing nanoscale effects that arise when heat is transferred between a hot and cold nanoscale-thick membrane via thermal radiation. Toward molecular computers: First measurement of single-molecule heat transfer07/22/2019 If Moore's law's endgame is really computer components made from single molecules, we're going to need to know how to cool them. U-M receives $6.25M to study heat-to-electricity conversion and cooling with LEDs05/03/2019 Michigan Engineering is leading four other universities in Department of Defense-funded research. ProQuest Distinguished Dissertation Awards of 2018 includes ME Postdoctoral Fellow04/12/2019 Work with radiative thermal transport at nanoscale level lands Dakotah Thompson a ProQuest Dissertation Award.
