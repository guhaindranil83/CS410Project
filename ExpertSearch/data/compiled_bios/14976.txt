Grill Professor of Biomedical Engineering Our research employs engineering approaches to understand and control neural function. We work on fundamental questions and applied development in electrical stimulation of the nervous system to restore function to individuals with neurological impairment or injury. Current projects include: understanding the mechanisms of and developing advanced approaches to deep brain stimulation to treat movement disorders, developing novel approaches to peripheral nerve electrical stimulation for restoration of bladder function, understanding the mechanisms of and developing advanced approaches to spinal cord stimulation to treat chronic pain, understanding and controlling the cellular effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation, and design of novel electrodes and waveforms for selective stimulation of the nervous system.
