Siebel Professor of Business Leadership, Strategy, and OrganizationsAffiliated Faculty, Woods Institute for the Environment at StanfordAcademic Area:Organizational BehaviorAdditional Administrative TitlesDirector, Stanford Executive Program: Be a Leader Who Matters Research StatementWilliam Barnett studies competition among people and organizations, as he explains the causes of exceptional performance and innovation. He is currently investigating competition among people and groups within organizations, especially noting the maladaptive consequences of intense competition within firms. By contrast, his previous work notes the often beneficial consequences of competition among companies so-called Red Queen competition - investigated in his articles and in his book The Red Queen among Organizations: How Competitiveness Evolves. Barnetts prior research includes studies of how strategic differences and strategic change among organizations affect their growth, performance, and survival. This research includes empirical studies of technical, regulatory, and ideological changes among organizations, and how these changes affect competitiveness over time and across markets across a wide range of industries and contexts. Barnett frequently speaks on strategy, innovation, and leadership. His views appear in the articles and videos on www.BarnettTalks.com.
