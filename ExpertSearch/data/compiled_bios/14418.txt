Chen James K. ChenJauch Professor and Professor of Chemical and Systems Biology, of Developmental Biology and of ChemistryOrganic ChemistryChemistry-Biology InterfaceChemical and developmental biologyChen Laboratory WebsiteAboutJames Chen received his A.B. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry and Chemical Biology from Harvard, and he completed his postdoctoral studies at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins. He joined the Stanford faculty in 2003, and his research interests span organic chemistry, chemical biology, developmental biology, and cancer biology.The Chen lab investigates the molecular mechanisms that underlie tissue patterning and tumorigenesis, guided by chemical principles and enabled by chemical technologies. For example, the Chen group has developed small-molecule inhibitors of Hedgehog signaling, a biochemical pathway that is required for multiple aspects of embryonic development and contributes to human cancer. Among these compounds are the first specific inhibitors of cytoplasmic dyneins, microtubule motors that regulate a signaling organelle called the primary cilium. Members of the lab have also synthesized photoactivatable antisense oligonucleotides that allow gene expression to be suppressed with spatiotemporal precision. By applying these tools in zebrafish embryos, they have elucidated the transcriptional programs that regulate formation of the notochord, somites, and other mesodermal tissues.More recently, the Chen group collaborated with the Harbury lab to devise new methods for time-resolved lanthanide microscopy. This approach takes advantage of the long-lived photoluminescence of lanthanide chelates, and it enables ultrasensitive, autofluorescence-free imaging of whole organisms. Current research interests in the lab include small-molecule modulators of stem cell metabolism, optogenetic tools for controlling developmental signaling pathways, spermiogenesis, and male contraception.
