Stern Career Development Professor Stefani Spranger studies how the bodys immune system interacts with growing tumors to harness the immune response to fight cancer. 617-715-5882 Phone 76-453D Office spranger@mit.edu Email Lab Website Paul Thompson Assistant 617-258-0480 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2011, Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich/Helmholtz-Zentrum Munich MSc, Biology, 2008, Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich/Helmholtz-Zentrum Munich BSc, Biology, 2005, Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich/Helmholtz-Zentrum Munich Research Summary We examine the interaction between cancer and immune cells. Using tumor mouse models designed to mimic tumor progression in humans, we investigate the co-evolution of the anti-tumor immune response and cancer. Understanding the interplay between tumor cells and immune cells will help develop and improve effective cancer immunotherapies.
