associate professor of economics at the UCLA UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs and the UCLA Anderson School of Management. He is also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a faculty affiliate at the Jameel Poverty Action Lab at MIT. He is currently serving as vice chair of the Department of Public Policy. His research focuses on health care, consumer finance and protections, and economic inequality. His recent work analyzes the prevalence of medical debt and its impact on consumer well-being and financial health, as well as the consequences of health care pricing reforms, insurance marketplace design and rising industry market power. Yins work has been published in leading economics and policy outlets such as the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the American Economic Review, the Review of Economics and Statistics and the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, and has covered by media outlets such as the Washington Post, New Yorker, Vox and others. From 2012 to 2014, Yin served in the Obama administration as acting chief economist and deputy assistant secretary for economic policy at the U.S. Treasury Department, and as a senior economist in the White House Council of Economic Advisers, where he advanced policies aimed at reducing student debt burden, improving affordability and quality of health care, and improving housing market stability and low-income home ownership. Since 2014, Yin has advised the state of California on health care reforms, including the design of the recent expansion of state premium subsidies for marketplace insurance. Previously, he was an assistant professor at the University of Chicago and Boston University, and a Robert Wood Johnson Scholar in Health Policy at Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University. Education Ph.D. Economics, Princeton University M.A. Economics, Princeton University B.S.
