Examples include dynamics of phase boundaries, cracks and dislocations in crystals, hysteresis in phase-transforming materials, solitary and heteroclinic traveling waves in nonlinear lattices and DNA overstretching. The resulting mathematical problems typically involve minimization of nonconvex functionals, nonlinear PDEs that change type, dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom and functional differential equations. Thus nonstandard analytical and numerical techniques are required.
