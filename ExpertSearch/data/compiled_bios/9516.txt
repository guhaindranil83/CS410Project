Bioengineering Education. Prof. Wheeler is particularly interested in the future of our young biomedical engineers. To this end he is heavily involved in UCSDs's new undergraduate Bioengineering Systems major, teaching and developing courses in instrumentation, signal processing and design. In his work with the UCSD Bioengineering: Systems UG major he emphasizes classical systems engineering but is cognizant that this education needs to take place in a context of genomics/informatics and the wearable/sensor/physiologic revolutions, both of which are changing the practice of medicine.Capsule Bio:Before moving to UCSD he has championed within the IEEE Engineering and Medical Bioengineering Society the growing emphasis on Biomedical and Health Informatics, a field which offers rapidly expanding job opportunities for biomedical engineers due to its huge practical impacts on health care effectiveness and cost, in addition to exploiting the genomics revolution. He is bringing into his classes an awareness of the tremendous impact that the wearable/sensor/wireless device explosion is having on biomedical engineering practice. For new students, Prof. Wheeler strongly recommends his MOOC "So you want to be a biomedical engineer" which is available for free at https://www.edx.org/course/so-you-want-become-biomedical-engineer-ieeex-biomed01x-0. This course was created by the IEEE EMBS with substantial help from D2 Creative (Somerset NJ). [Prof. Wheeler is particularly indebted to Laura Vitez who helped craft a more meaningful message to young bioengineers.] This course is available for free. Before joining UC San Diego, Dr. Wheeler was a professor and Acting Department Chair at the University of Florida, co-authoring Florida's new BME BS degree program proposal. Previously he had been on faculty at the University of Illinois where he was the Founding Head of the Bioengineering Department, authored the proposals and shepherded to completion the programs for the BS, MS and PhD. He also served as ECE Associate Head for Undergraduate Education and Chair of the Neuroscience Program. He earned his Ph.D. and Master's from Cornell and his Bachelor's from MIT. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, IEEE, BMES, AIMBE and IAMBE. He was President of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society in 2012-2013 and Editor of its flagship journal the IEEE Transactions on Bomedical Engineering. He adds that IEEE TBME is the world's most influential general BME journal and that IEEE EMBS is the world's oldest, largest, and most global biomedical engineering. Also, EMBS is most closely aligned with the engineering, clinical and industrial expansion into health care. Prof. Wheeler came through the research ranks with his interest in the application of electrical engineering methodologies to neuroscience. His work and laboratory influenced the development of neural spike sorting technologies, demonstrated that micro electrode array technology was useful for brain slice recording, and developed multiple micro lithographic techniques for controlling cell growth in culture, especially of neurons. This work aims at basic science understanding of the behavior of small populations of neurons, in hopes of creating better insight into the functioning of the brain. More recent work, in collaboration with GJ Brewer of UC Irvine and T DeMarse of the University of North Carolina has involved very novel reconstructions in vitro of the hippocampus from which we are gaining new insights into how this structure, critical to memory, encodes information.ResearchResearch Activities and FundingEngineering Form and Function in Neuronal NetworksNIH/NINDS R01NS052233May 3, 2006-Jan 31, 2017Role: Principal InvestigatorREAL-TIME NOISE CANCELLATION FOR HEARING AIDSNIH/NIDCD R21DC004840Jul 1, 2000-Jun 30, 2003Role: Principal InvestigatorMICROPATTERNED NEURAL NETWORKSNIH/NINDS R21NS038617Aug 24, 1999-Jul 31, 2002Role: Principal InvestigatorMICROSTAMPING PROTEINS AND MICROPATTERNING NEURONSNIH/NCRR R55RR013320Sep 30, 1998-Sep 29, 2001Role: Principal InvestigatorPATTERNED NEURONAL NETWORKSNIH/NCRR R03RR006870Apr 1, 1991-Mar 31, 1993Role: Principal Investigator BibliographicPublications Publications listed below are automatically derived from MEDLINE/PubMed and other sources, which might result in incorrect or missing publications.
