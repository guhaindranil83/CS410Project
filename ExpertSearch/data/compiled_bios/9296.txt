His current research interests include the origin and crystallization of the K/Pg Deccan flood basalts of India, igneous activity and metamorphism in the Cenozoic Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt, and high-grade metamorphism in eastern India with implications for Proterozoic-Paleozoic supercontinent break-up and assembly. He has also collaborated in studying hydrous peridotite melting in the mantle wedge. Nilanjan obtained his B.Sc. (1981) and M.Sc. (1983) from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, and his Ph.D. (1989) from City University of New York. His Ph.D. thesis involved creating an internally consistent thermodynamic database to calculate phase equilibria. During 1990-1991, he served as a postdoctoral assistant at American Museum of Natural History, New York, where he studied meteorites. Nilanjan has over 25 years of experience with the electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA, or the electron microprobe) and its applications in the earth and material sciences. He oversees the operation of the Electron Microprobe Laboratory (a research facility within EAPS), teaches the theory and application of the x-ray micro-analytical technique, and provides training for students, researchers and the faculty.
