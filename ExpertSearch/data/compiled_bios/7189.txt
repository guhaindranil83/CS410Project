He received B.S. (1994), M.S. (1997), and Ph.D. (2000) degrees all from the Computer Science Department of University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During 2000-2001, he was a post-doctoral scholar at UCLA, and a senior engineer at Aplus Design Technologies, Inc. In August 2001, he joined the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology an assistant professor. He is currently the director of the GTCAD (Georgia Tech Computer Aided Design) Laboratory at the School. He recently released a CD with his rock band in Los Angeles and spends his leisure time writing/recording music.
