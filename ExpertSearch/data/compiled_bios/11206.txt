Dr. Hoh was trained in mathematics in Taiwan and theoretical statistics and probability under the supervision of Professor Zhiliang Ying and the late Professor Herbert Robbins at Rutgers University.As a research assistant professor at Rockefeller University she worked with Jurg Ott on linkage analysis for genetic factors of human disease and developed her expertise in biology. Two of the computational methods and tools they developed, SUMSTAT and p53MH, continue to be widely used. SUMSTAT can efficiently and effectively identify disease associated genetic variants, while p53MH and its extension can identify the DNA response elements of a tumor suppressor p53 as well as other transcription factors.Now an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health, Hoh focuses on developing new approaches to discover the genetic risks for more common diseases which usually have complex influences from both genetics and environmental exposures. Collaborating with national and international groups (Drs. Emily Chew and Rick Ferris at the National Eye Institute and Dr. Calvin Pang of Hong Kong University) her work on age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of blindness in developed world, led to the first successful application of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach and was published widely. By employing GWAS, the Hoh lab has also investigated other complex traits including carcinoid cancer, scleroderma, asthma, longevity, among others.Education & TrainingPhDRutgers University (1998)BSNational Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan (1989)Departments & OrganizationsChronic Disease EpidemiologyHigh Performance ComputationHoh LabOffice of Cooperative ResearchYale Cancer CenterYale School of Public HealthYale UniversityEdit Profile30 Eventsyou could attend in December 2020YSPH CalendarInnovatingThrough CollaborationReserve a RoomP.O.
