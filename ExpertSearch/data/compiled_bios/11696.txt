Primarily focused on his role in academia, Michael continues to occasionally consult for industry partners and to volunteer with groups exploring the boundary between art and engineering and promoting STEM/STEAM education via outreach events and workshops. Michael Wehner is not currently accepting new consulting opportunities. Education Michael Wehner earned his PhD from the University of California at Berkeley in 2009. Additionally, he conducted post-doctoral research (2011-2013) and a research fellowship (2013-2017) at Harvard University. Selected Publications: Ranzani, T., Russo, S., Bartlett, N.
