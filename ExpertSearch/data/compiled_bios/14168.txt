That is, my work falls within the general area of Critical Zone Science with a particular focus on northern cold regions (e.g., Canada's temperate to subarctic and permafrost regions) to understand the impacts of climate warming and human activities on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, water resources and the sustainability of Canadas water, soil and other natural resources. My fundamental and applied research on soil and water quality and hydrogeochemical processes contribute to the understanding of the complex process dynamics within soils, sediments and surface water and groundwaters, from both physical and hydrogeochemical perspectives, and how these processes are better informed by an improved examination of surface water and groundwater interactions and subsurface hydro(bio)geochemical processes. I have extensive experience in innovative approaches and novel laboratory and field techniques for terrestrial and wetland ecosystems, specifically with soil and water quality, and nutrient and greenhouse gas flux monitoring. I have recently developed and implemented novel techniques in the lab, including automated water table fluctuating and freeze-thaw soil column systems, an automated flow injection switch-box, pore water sampling devices, hydro(bio)geophysical sensor and high resolution electrochemistry sensors for innovative research projects, which will allow to advance my research by upscaling the bench scale systems for validating and accurately addressing physical and chemical heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales and to develop models of hydrogeochemical processes at watershed scale. Since becoming a faculty member in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, I have brought new and unique strengths in environmental science and initiated a large number of research projects. I have been a PI, Co-PI or collaborator on grants totaling more than $14M from a diversity of funding sources, including the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council (NSERC), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the CFREF-funded Global Water Futures program, Qatar National Research Fund, US Department of Energy, and industrial partners. Recognized for my dedication to international research collaborations, I have trained >70 PhD, MSc and BSc students and Postdoctoral Fellows. My current research areas include studies on: Hydrogeochemical processes of aquatic-terrestrial interfaces Biogeochemical cyclesof nutrients Water quality Terrestrial ecosystem processes Groundwater-surface water interactions Hydrological and biogeochemical processes of peatlands and wetlands Seasonal freeze/thaw dynamics Flow and transport in porous media (particularly in complex dual-porosity) HydroBioGeoPhysics: Geophysical methods to assess subsurface biogeochemical processes Reactive interfaces in agroecosystem Winter soil processes Fate and transport of nutrients Google Scholar Profile Contact Office:EIT2006 Phone:519-888-4567ext. 31328 E-mail:frezanez@uwaterloo.ca Affiliation:University of Waterloo Profiles by type Faculty (2)Staff (4)Researcher (13)Graduate student (12)Undergraduate student (1) TOP Share Ecohydrology research group University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
