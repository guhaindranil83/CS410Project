His thesis work pertained to the study and application of speech analysis techniques in the classification and recognition of stress and emotion. In particular, his dissertation presented an in-depth analysis of objectively measurable features of speech that were useable in creating patterns of separation between normal voices and those exhibiting the emotional disorder of clinical depression. After working in a post-doctorate position for about a year, Dr. Moore joined Georgia Tech as an assistant professor in the fall of 2004 and was appointed as the School's associate chair for Undergraduate Affairs in August 2017. He continues his research in using digital speech processing theory and analysis in the classification of human vocal patterns for determining speaker demographics (i.e., dialect, language, etc.), speaker characteristics (i.e., gender, dimensions, etc.), and speaker state (i.e., emotion, stress, etc.). Research interests: Voice analysis Speech feature extraction Voice synthesis/ conversion Glottal waveform analysis, estimation, and quality evaluation Feature selection/ Pattern classification Distinctions: Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant Award (2003) National Science Foundation Fellow (1998-2001) President's Fellow (1998-2002) FACES Fellow (2002-2003) NSF CAREER Award (2006) Moore, E. and Clements, M., "Algorithm for automatic glottal waveform estimation without the reliance on precise glottal closure information," in Proceedings, ICASSP, Vol. 1, pgs. 101-104, 2004 Barnwell III, T., Clements, M., Anderson, D.V., Moore, E., Lee, M., Ertan, E., Krishnan, V., Choi, W., Hu, J., Demiroglu, C., Whitehead, S. and Durey, A.
