While in the Great Lakes region his research focused on the physiology, population genetics and impacts from invasive aquatic species. More recent work has centered on Palmyra Atoll in the Central Pacific Ocean. Courses taught include Experimental Design & Statistical Methods, Animal Physiology, Introductory Biology and Senior Project Lab. Since 2003 he has served as the Director of the Pacific Study Abroad Program, which includes courses on the ecology and biogeography of New Zealand, Australia and Fiji.
