Faculty Andreas H. Hielscher Professor and Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering Biomedical Engineering Connect Professor Hielscher leads the recently established Department of Biomedical Engineering and directs research in his Clinical Biophotonics Laboratory (CBL). The mission of the CBL is to establish optical tomography as a viable biomedical imaging modality and transfer this technology into clinical practice. The goal is to develop a patient-centered approach that addresses all aspect of modern precision medicine in state-of-the art healthcare. To this end Prof. Hielscher's team is developing cutting- edge imaging hardware and software that provide 3-dimensional distributions of physiologically relevant parameters such as oxygen saturation or total hemoglobin concentrations and more. This includes the design of wearable devices that allow continuous patient monitoring. The CBL is currently applying this emerging technology in various clinical and preclinical studies that focus on the diagnosis and monitoring breast cancer, arthritis, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and diabetic foot syndrome (DFS). Furthermore, techniques are being developed for real-time monitoring of brain activities. Research Interests: Biomedical Imaging, Medical Instrumentation, Biophotonics, Biomedical Optics, Near-Infrared Imaging, Tomography, Image Reconstruction, Medical Imaging Analysis, Wearable Devices, Imaging of: Breast Cancer, Skin Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Peripheral Artery Diseases (PAD), Diabetic foot Syndrome (DFS), Brain, Modeling of Light Transport in Tissue, Equation of Radiative Transfer (ERT).
