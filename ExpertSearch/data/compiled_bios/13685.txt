His research focuses on seismic risk analysis and design of critical engineering structures; reliability and safety analysis of engineering systems; dynamic stability of structures; structural dynamics and random vibration; nonlinear dynamics, and stochastic mechanics. Professor Xies primary research pertains to the reliability, and safety analysis and design of nuclear power plants; on-shore and off-shore structures; and tall buildings that are subjected to loading caused by earthquakes, ocean waves, and wind turbulence. The objective of his research is to have a better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of structures, and to provide methods for safety and reliability analysis, and design of structures, machinery, and engineering systems as a whole. As a result of his research and teaching, Professor Xie has received several awards such as the Distinguished Teacher Award from the University of Waterloo in 2007, and Teaching Excellence Award from the Faculty of Engineering in 2001. He also received the Distinguished Performance Award for outstanding contribution in teaching, scholarship and service in 2000, 2006, and 2013. Professor Xie has written 2 textbooks: Dynamic Stability of Structures and Differential Equations for Engineers, both published by the Cambridge University Press. He has authored and co-authored over 100 referred journal publications. He is a member of the Canadian Standards Association N289 Technical Committee on Seismic Design. He also serves as the Associate Editor or Member of Editorial Board of a number of international journals, such as the ASME Journal of Applied Mechanics, Mechanics Based Design of Structures and Machines, Journal of Nonlinear Systems and Applications, and Advances in Civil Engineering.Research InterestsStructural dynamics and random vibrationdynamic stability of structuresnonlinear dynamics and stochastic mechanicsLocalization in randomly disordered structuresVibration design using cold-formedresidential floor systemsStructuresMechanics & ConstructionSeismic analysisreliability and safety analysisApplied mechanics and stochastic systemsEducation1990, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo1987, Master's, MASc, University of Waterloo1986, Master's, MEng, Ministry of Aerospace1984, Bachelor's, BE, Shanghai Jiao TongCourses*CIVE 127 - Statics & Solid Mechanics 1Taught in 2015CIVE 701 - Topics in MechanicsTaught in 2015, 2016ENVE 127 - Statics and Solid MechanicsTaught in 2015CIVE 105 - Mechanics 2Taught in 2016, 2018, 2019CIVE 222 - Differential EquationsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsAlwan, Mohamad S and Liu, Xinzhi and Xie, Wei-Chau, Stability properties of nonlinear stochastic impulsive systems with time delay, Stochastic Analysis and Applications, 34(1), 2016, 117 - 136Wang, Xiying and Liu, Xinzhi and Xie, Wei-chau and Xu, Wei and Xu, Yong, Global stability and persistence of HIV models with switching parameters and pulse control, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 123, 2016, 53 - 67Liu, Xinzhi and Zhang, Kexue and Xie, Wei-Chau, Pinning Impulsive Synchronization of Reaction-Diffusion Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays, , 2016Wang, Zhaoliang and Xie, Wei-Chau and Pandey, MD, Computationally Efficient Vector-Valued Seismic Risk Analysis of Engineering Structures, Journal of Structural Engineering, 2016 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
