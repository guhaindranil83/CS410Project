Burton Swanson Research Professor and Director of the Information Systems Research Program Most people think of technology as physical stuff, but I like to think of it as a capability. burt.swanson@anderson.ucla.edu (310) 825-3654 About Biography Recent Papers Career Publications Other Biography E. Burton Swanson is Research Professor and Director of the Information Systems Research Program at UCLA Anderson School of Management.

Earlier he worked with IBM, primarily in application system development. Since obtaining his doctorate at UC Berkeley, Professor Swanson has held visiting positions in Germany, Belgium and England. Professor Swanson is a Fellow of the Association for Information Systems (AIS) and also a recipient of its LEO award for exceptional lifetime achievement. He was the founding Editor-in-Chief of the journal, Information Systems Research, 1987-92. Earlier, in 1980, he was also a co-founder of the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS). Professor Swanson's research examines the life cycles of systems in organizations, addressing issues of innovation, implementation, utilization, and maintenance. He has authored more than one hundred scholarly articles.
