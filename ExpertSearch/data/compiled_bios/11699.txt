Her overall goal is to further our understanding of disease mechanisms and visualize and detect cancer at the molecular level. Her current projects aim to advance the sensitivity and spatial and temporal resolutions of radiation emission (optical, gamma rays, positrons) to achieve high-quantitative accuracy and image quality of molecular probes in vivo.
