Coyle received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Delaware in 1978, and master's and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University in 1980 and 1982. From 1982 through 2007, he was a faculty member at Purdue University, where he served at various times as assistant vice provost for research, co-director of the Center for Wireless Systems and Applications, and co-founder of both the Vertically-Integrated Projects (VIP) program and the Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program. During the 2006-07 academic year, he was the Kenan Trust Visiting Professor at Princeton University. Dr. Coyle joined Georgia Tech in 2008 and is currently the Arbutus Chair for the Integration of Research and Education at Georgia Tech, a Georgia Research Alliance Eminent Scholar, and director of the Arbutus Center for the Integration of Research and Education.
