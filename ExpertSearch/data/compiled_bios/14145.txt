Sheand her research group have used these patterns todevelop parsimonious, minimum calibration models that can effectively interface with climate and land-use change models to provide insights into water management on local and regional scales. Modeling in Prof. Basu's lab is complemented by experimental research to develop innovative, low cost, passive water quality samplers for surface and groundwater applications. She is also collaborates with ecologists, social scientists and economists to explore other aspects of sustainable water management.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
