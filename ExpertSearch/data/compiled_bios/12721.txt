My ultimate goal is to build intelligent machines, capable of recreating our visual world. I study machine learning models that can learn to automatically synthesize visual content and virtual worlds by understanding and modeling millions of images and videos. Along the way, the learned models will also understand why our world looks the way it does, discovering knowledge useful for recognition and reasoning tasks. I will be joining the CMU School of Computer Science as an assistant professor in Fall 2020. I did a postdoc at MIT CSAIL, working with William T. Freeman, Josh Tenenbaum, and Antonio Torralba. I obtained my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Alexei A. Efros. I received my B.E. from Tsinghua University. My Ph.D. research was awarded the Facebook Fellowship, ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and UC Berkeley EECS David J. Sakrison Memorial Prize for outstanding doctoral research. My co-authored work received NVIDIA Pioneer Research Award, and SIGGRAPH 2019 Real-time Live! Best of Show Award and Audience Choice Award.
