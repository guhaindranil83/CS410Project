Percus Professor of Mathematics and Physics percus@cims.nyu.edu 212-998-3130 Warren Weaver Hall, Office 501 Education Ph.D., Physics, Columbia University, USA, 1954. M.A., Mathematics, Columbia University, USA, 1948. B.S., Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, USA, 1947. Research Interests A common thread among my research activities is the study of relations between high and low resolution solutions of mathematical and physical problems. Directions of current interest include the use of exact inequalities to obtain tight estimates of properties of large electron systems (see first publication below), controlled dimensional reduction of particles and fluids in nanolevel enclosures of large aspect ratio (see second publication below), and self-interacting random walks on networks (see final publication below).
