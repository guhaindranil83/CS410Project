I lead the Mobile and Networked Systems Laboratory (MANSys) at GSU. My research interests include mobile computing, IoT systems, HCI, wireless networks, and multimedia. I am especially interested in the networking and cybersecurity issues of immersive VR/AR systems and camera-sensor-based cyber-physical systems. I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. I also worked at Stanford University as a visiting researcher. I received my M.Eng. and B.Eng. degrees from the University of Science and Technology of China and Shandong University, respectively. I am honored to have received several research awards, including an NSF CRII award, the ACM SIGMM Best Ph.D. Dissertation Award, the University at Buffalo CSE Best Dissertation Award, the ACM HotMobile 2018 Best Demo Award, and the University at Buffalo David M. Benenson Memorial Award. I was also runner-up for the IEEE HealthCom 2014 Best Student Paper. Publications Z. Yanand C. W.
