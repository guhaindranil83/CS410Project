Mallick Civil & Environmental Engineering Professor Education:Jadavpur University, India 1989MS Auburn University, USA 1993PhD Auburn University, USA 1997 Rajib Basu Mallick is currently the Ralph White Family Distinguished Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at WPI. He graduated from Jadavpur University, India, in 1989 and received his masters degree and PhD from Auburn University, USA. He also worked as a senior research associate at the National Center for Asphalt Technology, USA. Rajibs main research interests are in the optimum utilization of natural resources and sustainable construction, specifically related to the pavement industry. His work focuses on recycling of asphalt pavements, understanding and modeling the behavior of recycled materials, reducing the urban heat island effect, harvesting energy from pavements, understanding temperature profiles, and reducing temperatures in pavement layers. Rajib has over 150 journal and conference publications, two textbooks, and a U.S. patent. He has conducted numerous research projects and has consulted in the area of both highway and airport pavements. He is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Massachusetts, and a Fellow of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).
