His work includes not only onboard sensing and perception, but also the human operators and personnel forming the complete system. One key component of his work is the idea of mutual adaptation, or enabling robots to alter their behaviors based on their operators' experiences and physiological signals of opportunity. While his work is broadly applicable to any system involving autonomy and humans, his principal application involves systems performing the dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks particularly suited to human-robot teams. Research Areas Field robotics, perception, human/robot interaction, psychophysiology, supervisory control, human-in-the-loop decision making, high-risk environments Are you Dr. Steve McGuire?
