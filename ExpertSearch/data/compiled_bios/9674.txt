Biography Dr. Xiaolin Hus research interests include modeling and simulation, complex systems science, agent and multi-agent system, and advanced computing in parallel and cloud environments. His work covers both fundamental research and applications of computer modeling and simulation. In fundamental research, Dr. Hu has been developing Dynamic Data-Driven Simulation (DDDS), where a simulation system is continually influenced by real-time data for better analysis and prediction of a system under study. He employs Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods (also called Particle Filters) to assimilate real-time sensor data to dynamically adjust a simulation and its models. The developed methods are applied to large-scale wildfire simulations and other applications. On the topic of agent and multi-agent systems, he studies autonomous agent behavior and develops multi-agent coordination mechanisms for autonomous systems such as unmanned aircraft systems and autonomous robots. Dr. Hu also works on modeling and simulation methodologies and agent-based modeling and simulation for studying complex systems and their emergent behaviors. Dr. Hus research has been well funded. Currently, he is the lead PI for several research projects, including a project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and a multi-institute project funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to develop technologies of unmanned aircraft systems for supporting wildfire management, His past research was funded by NSF, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
