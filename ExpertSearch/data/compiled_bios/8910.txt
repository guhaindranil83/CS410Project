At Stanford GSB I teach courses aimed at helping MBA students better manage themselves and further develop their leadership and interpersonal skills. I teach three sections of The Art of Self-Coaching (OB527), a course that I designed and launched in 2015. The course aims to help professionals and aspiring leaders be more intentional in managing their continued growth and development. In 2016 and 2017 I also taught Interpersonal Dynamics (OB374), the schools most popular elective and known to most students as Touchy Feely. (When I accepted Stanford GSBs invitation to add a third section of Self-Coaching, I decided to resign from the Touchy Feely faculty, as my other commitments preclude me from teaching more than one class per Quarter at Stanford.) From 2007 to 2016 at Stanford GSB I provided individual coaching and led teams in the Arbuckle Leadership Fellows Program and taught sections of Leadership Labs, both of which I helped to launch in 2007. During that time I also facilitated groups in Interpersonal Dynamics, a role that I continue to play during the courses weekend retreats. As an executive coach I work with senior leaders who are facing a challenge or would like to be more effective or fulfilled in their roles. Most of my clients are technology company CEOs, and Ive worked with leaders in fields from accounting to investing to the law. I see most clients in person in San Francisco, and I work virtually with others across and outside the U.S. Issues I often address with clients include managing relationships with key employees and others, improving exec team dynamics, transitioning from technical expert to leader, evolving company culture, and better self-care. My work as a coach began after a 15-year career in management, during which I took two years off to attend Stanford GSB and helped launch three new organizations. I write about coaching and professional development at edbatista.com and at HBR.org. Im a co-author of the HBR Guides to Coaching Employees and Delivering Effective Feedback, and Im currently writing a book on self-coaching for HBR Press. Im married to Amy Wright, and weve lived in San Francisco since 1990. In addition to my MBA from Stanford, I earned a BA in History, magna cum laude, from Brown University.Teaching Degree Courses 2020-21 OB 527: The Art of Self-Coaching In 2009 a student who was about to graduate said to me, "Being coached at the GSB helped me grow over the last two years, but after I leave school and no longer have access to these resources, how will I continue to coach myself?"This course is... 2019-20 OB 527: The Art of Self-Coaching In 2009 a student who was about to graduate said to me, "Being coached at the GSB helped me grow over the last two years, but after I leave school and no longer have access to these resources, how will I continue to coach myself?"This course is... 2018-19 OB 527: The Art of Self-Coaching In 2009 a student who was about to graduate said to me, "Being coached at the GSB helped me grow over the last two years, but after I leave school and no longer have access to these resources, how will I continue to coach myself?"This course is...
