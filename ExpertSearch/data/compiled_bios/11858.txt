Computational fluid dynamics applications to improve crop production systems. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 93, 151-167.More infoAbstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), numerical analysis and simulation tools of fluid flow processes have emerged from the development stage and become nowadays a robust design tool. It is widely used to study various transport phenomena which involve fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, providing detailed information for spatial and temporal distributions of flow speed and direction, pressure, temperature and species concentration. The CFD tools provide a cost-effective way of carrying out equipment and process design and optimization, and can reduce risk in equipment modification and process scale-up. In recent years, CFD modeling has been gaining attraction from the agri-food industry. The present paper provides a state-of-the-art review on various CFD applications to improve crop farming systems such as, soil tillage, sprayers, harvesting, machinery, and greenhouses. The challenges faced by modelers using CFD in precision crop production are discussed and possibilities for incorporating the CFD models in decision support tools for Precision Farming are highlighted. 2012 Elsevier B.V.Kacira, M. -., Villarreal-Guerrero, F., Kacira, ., , E., Linker, R., Giacomelli, G., Arbel, A., & Kubota, C.

Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 93, 168-183.More infoAbstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a proven simulation tool which caters to almost any field of study. The CFD technique is utilized to simulate, analyze, and optimize various engineering designs. In this review, the discussion is focused on the application of CFD in the external atmospheric processes as well as modeling in land and water management. With respect to its application in environmental investigations, numerous CFD studies have been done in the atmospheric processes where generally only the fluid flow characteristics are investigated. The application of CFD to soil and water management is still limited. However, with the present demand for conservation and sustainable management of our soil and water resources, CFD application in this field is fast emerging especially in structure designs of dams and reservoirs where CFD offers fast reliable results with less labor and cost. Every CFD model should be validated in order to be considered accurate and reliable. However, a benchmark or standard procedures in validating CFD models is not yet available. This probably answers why the success of the CFD models is still mostly attributed to the user's skills and experience. At present, the degree of application of CFD to the agro-environmental field is limited by the computing power and software used, however, the fast ever computing power of PCs continually expands the potential of CFD and can be generally more flexible at accounting for the unique aspects of every CFD project. This allows easy access to conduct simulation studies from simple to complex models. In this paper, after a state of art analysis of the past and present application of CFD in the agro-environmental applications, its future directions were discussed, in order to potentially serve as a guide for researchers and engineers on what project or investigations can be conducted. 2012 Elsevier B.V.Tamimi, E., & Kacira, M. (2013). Analysis of climate uniformity in a naturally ventilated greenhouse equipped with high pressure fogging system using computational fluid dynamics. Acta Horticulturae, 1008, 177-184.More infoAbstract: High pressure fogging systems and control strategies in naturally ventilated (NV) greenhouses has been investigated as an alternative cooling mechanism to mechanical ventilation systems with aims of saving energy and water and potentially helping to improve climate uniformity in the greenhouse. Studies on analyzing the climate uniformity under NV with fogging, including the analysis of greenhouse aerodynamics, climate uniformity lacks. A 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis was used to simulate environment conditions of a NV greenhouse equipped with high pressure fogging. The study utilized models including porous media to simulate crop canopy, the Solar Load model and the Discrete Ordinates radiation model to simulate solar radiation, the species transport and the discrete phase to simulate evaporation of droplets and evapotranspiration. Experimental data collected from a single-span greenhouse was used to validate combined model. Simulated environmental variables are compared between a scenario with fogging activated and the same scenario without fogging. The simulated temperature and relative humidity at 21 points were compared to corresponding experimental measurements with percentage errors of 6-16% and 14-27%, respectively (99% confidence). There were no statistically significant differences between the simulated and experimental data sets determined by ANOVA (=0.1). The results showed that there is a significant effect of fogging on temperature and VPD uniformity. In addition, it was shown that the air flow pattern had a significant effect on the internal environmental variables. The positions and angels of the fogging nozzle affected the interior climate.Tamimi, E., Kacira, M. -., Choi, C., & An, L. (2013).

(2013). Analysis of microclimate uniformity in a naturally vented greenhouse with a high-pressure fogging system. Transactions of the ASABE, 56(3), 1241-1254.More infoAbstract: Controlled environments have long played an important role in the field of agriculture because they enable growers to more precisely regulate not only the quantity of a crop but the quality as well. Currently, most controlled environments rely on mechanical systems to regulate temperature and relative humidity within the controlled space, but these systems can be costly to install and operate. For this reason, researchers have begun investigating the efficacy of using high-pressure fogging systems and their associated control strategies in naturally ventilated greenhouses as an alternative to mechanical cooling methods. However, conducting detailed analyses of a greenhouse's aerodynamics requires carefully arrayed instruments, a consideration of many different scenarios, and a significant amount of time to compile data, not to mention the monetary cost of experimental analysis. The objective of this study, then, was to develop a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model capable of more efficiently analyzing the movement of air in a naturally ventilated greenhouse equipped with a high-pressure fogging system. The overall model included five subunits: (1) a porous media model to simulate the ways that a crop canopy will affect airflow, (2) a solar load model and (3) a discrete ordinates radiation model to simulate solar radiation, (4) a species transport and discrete phase model to simulate evaporation of droplets, and (5) an evapotranspiration (ET) model integrated with a user-defined function (UDF). The overall model predicted temperature and relative humidity within the greenhouse with percentage errors for temperature and relative humidity of 5.7% to 9.4% and 12.2% to 26.9%, respectively (given a 95% confidence interval). The average percent error between the simulated and measured ET was around 8%, and the CFD-simulated stomatal and aerodynamic resistances agreed well and were within the ranges indicated by earlier research. Having validated the overall model with experimental data, we then used a 24 full-factorial design to determine the effects on climate uniformity produced by four factors: position of the side vent, position of the vertical sprayer nozzles, position of the horizontal sprayer nozzles, and angle of the nozzle. On the basis of our statistical analysis, we concluded that "horizontal nozzle position" was the most significant factor for climate uniformity, while the least significant factor among those evaluated was "side vent opening.". 2013 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.Boscheri, G., Kacira, M., Patterson, L., Giacomelli, G., Sadler, P., Furfaro, R., Lobascio, C., Lamantea, M., & Grizzaff, .

Wind tunnel measurement of aerodynamic properties of a tomato canopy. Transactions of the ASABE, 55(5), 1921-1927.More infoAbstract: This study was conducted to determine the drag coefficient and the relationship between permeability (K) and momentum loss coefficients (C f) of a tomato canopy for various leaf area densities. The experiments were conducted in a large-scale wind tunnel system with a tomato canopy. The static pressures and air velocity measurements were performed at several heights in the y-direction and various positions in the z-direction in the wind tunnel test section. The relationship between pressure drop and air velocity across the tomato canopy was determined using a porous medium approach. A drag coefficient of 0.31 was obtained for the tomato canopy used in the experiment. The permeability of the tomato canopy ranged from 0.006 to 0.65 for a leaf area density (L) of 4 (m2 m-3), from 0.004 to 0.41 for L = 5, and from 0.003 to 0.3 for L = 6 as Cf changed from 0.1 to 1. Thus, a mature tomato canopy having L = 6 could be used with a canopy permeability of K = 0.017 and a momentum loss coefficient of Cf = 0.245. 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.Villarreal-Guerrero, F., Kacira, M. -., Kacira, M., Villarreal-Guerrero, F., , E., Kacira, ., Linker, R., , E., Kubota, C., Linker, R., Giacomelli, G., Kubota, C., Arbel, A., Giacomelli, G., & Arbel, A.

Validation of CFD simulations for three dimensional temperature distributions of a naturally ventilated multispan greenhouse obtained by wind tunnel measurements. Acta Horticulturae, 893, 571-580.More infoAbstract: In the last decade there has been an exponential increase in the number of research works using computational fluid dynamic simulations to study natural ventilation processes in greenhouses. The main reasons for this are that Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations can provide a vast amount of information in a cost effective way in a reasonable time period compared to experimental techniques. It also provides designers and researchers a very fast and reliable tool to improve natural ventilation designs by studying the effects of multiple combinations of vent cases and external climatic conditions. However, the main limiting factor of the simulations is that validation studies must be performed with some source of experimental data, which are normally very scarce, due to high costs of time and money. In the present work, a CFD package has been used to perform simulations of a set of previous experiments conducted in a wind tunnel with naturally ventilated multi-span greenhouse with scaled models. The main focus of the current study was to compare three dimensional temperature distributions obtained for different ventilation cases from wind tunnel study with CFD simulations to validate the model. After a first set of simulations the quantitative agreement found for the temperature distribution in the middle vertical plane of the greenhouse for the four vent cases studied was only approximate, whereas for the mid horizontal plane the agreements was less good, with values in all cases lower than in the experiments. The qualitative comparison of the temperature distribution on both middle planes (vertical and horizontal) showed fairly good agreement for cases in which side vents were opened in combination with the roof vents whereas the agreements for those cases in which only roof vents opened was not similar. In view of this, two new turbulence models were used checking the effect on the agreement with experimental results, in order to have a better knowledge of the simulations set up for future validations.Kacira, M. -., Striemer, G., StoryDL, ., Akoglu, A., & KaciraM, .

The controllers were designed using the robust control method "Quantitative Feedback Theory" that guarantees adequate performance of the controlled system despite large modeling uncertainties and disturbances. The design of the controllers and their initial validation were performed in a small experimental greenhouse, and the same controllers were later implemented in a much larger greenhouse located in a warmer and drier region. Good tracking performances were observed in both greenhouses.Linker, R., Kacira, M., & Arbel, A. (2011). Robust climate control of a greenhouse equipped with variable-speed fans and a variable-pressure fogging system. Biosystems Engineering, 110(2), 153-167.More infoAbstract: A climate control system for a small greenhouse equipped with a variable-pressure fogging system and variable-speed extracting fans was developed and validated. The controllers were designed using the robust control method quantitative feedback theory (QFT) that guarantees adequate performance of the controlled system despite large modelling uncertainties and disturbances. In order to simplify the design of the controllers and achieve better performances, partial decoupling between the two control loops was achieved by describing the greenhouse climate in terms of air enthalpy and humidity ratio. This led to using ventilation for achieving the desired air enthalpy, and fogging for achieving the desired humidity ratio, assuming that the ventilation rate was approximately known. The implementation results demonstrated the good performance of the controllers, with mean tracking errors of ~100 J kg-1 [dry air] and ~0.1 g [water] kg-1 [dry air] for enthalpy and humidity ratio, respectively. For practical applications, the desired climate was expressed in terms of air temperature and relative humidity, which were converted into enthalpy and humidity ratio using the psychrometric relationships. In this case, the mean tracking errors were ~0.2 C air temperature and less than 1% relative humidity, and the maximum mean deviations over a 10-min period with constant setpoints were 2.5 C air temperature and 5% relative humidity. 2011 IAgrE.Linker, R., Kacira, M., & ArbelA, .

Seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETc) values were 633, 740, 815 and 903 mm in the 1st year and were 679, 777, 875 and 990 mm in the 2nd year for T-50, T-75, T-100 and T-125, respectively. Seasonal irrigation water amounts were 542, 677, 813 and 949 mm in 2002 and 576, 725, 875 and 1025 mm in 2003, respectively. Maximum marketable fruit yield was from T-100 treatment with 76.65 t ha-1 in 2002 and 68.13 t ha-1 in 2003. Fruit yield was reduced significantly, as irrigation rate was decreased. The water use efficiency (WUE) ranged from 7.37 to 9.40 kg m-3 and 6.32 to 7.79 kg m-3 in 2002 and 2003, respectively, while irrigation water use efficiencies (IWUE) were between 7.02 and 9.93 kg m-3 in 2002 and between 6.11 and 8.82 kg m -3 in 2003. When the irrigation rate was decreased, crop transpiration rate decreased as well resulting in increased crop canopy temperatures and CWSI values and resulted in reduced yield. The results indicated that a seasonal mean CWSI value of 0.20 would result in decreased yield. Therefore, a CWSI = 0.20 could be taken as a threshold value to start irrigation for cucumber grown in open field under semi-arid conditions. Results of this study demonstrate that 1.00 IW/CPE water applications by a drip system in a 3-day irrigation frequency would be optimal for growth in semiarid regions. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Japan Agricultural Research Quarterly, 38(4), 227-233.More infoAbstract: In this paper, the effects of wind speed, side ventilators and span numbers on gothic type multi-span greenhouse natural ventilation were studied by numerical simulation using the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach. The realizable k- model was used for the turbulence model in the simulations. The results showed that the maximum greenhouse ventilation rate was achieved when both side and roof vents were used for ventilation. Without the existence of buoyancy effect in the computations, it was found that the ventilation rate increased linearly with the external wind speed in all the cases studied. The ratio of the opening of the ventilator area to the greenhouse floor area, 9.6%, was found to be small compared to the recommended ratios of 15-25%. The results showed that a significant reduction in ventilation rate was determined as the number of spans was increased and an exponential decay explained the relationship between the ventilation rate and the number of spans.Kacira, M., Sase, S., & Okushima, L. (2004). Optimization of vent configuration by evaluating greenhouse and plant canopy ventilation rates under wind-induced ventilation. Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers, 47(6), 2059-2067.More infoAbstract: The effects of greenhouse vent configurations, plant existence, and external wind speeds on ventilation rates and airflow patterns in a greenhouse and plant canopy zone under wind-induced ventilation were investigated. The optimization of traditional vent configuration for a two-span glasshouse for better air renewal, especially in the plant canopy zone, was attempted by three-dimensional numerical simulations using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The realizable k- model was used for a turbulent model, and the existence of the plants in the greenhouse was modeled by a porous medium method. Prior to the optimization, the CFD model was verified with the results of an experimental study of natural ventilation. The CFD model adequately matched those results. The ventilation rates, both in the greenhouse and in the plant canopy zone, were proportional to external wind speed. Maximum greenhouse ventilation rates were achieved when rollup type side vents were used in the side walls and both side and roof vents were fully open (case 3). For example, the ventilation rate for this vent configuration was 6.03 m3 m-2 min-1 at an external wind speed of 1.5 m s-1. The greenhouse ventilation rate for this vent configuration was almost the same as when the butterfly-type side and roof vents were fully open (case 1). However, the use of a rollup side vent considerably improved the ventilation rate in the plant canopy zone. This showed that ventilation in the plant canopy zone was significantly affected by internal airflow patterns caused by different vent configurations. 2004 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.Kacira, M., Simsek, M., Babur, Y., & Demirkol, S. (2004). Determining optimum tilt angles and orientations of photovoltaic panels in Sanliurfa, Turkey. Renewable Energy, 29(8), 1265-1275.More infoAbstract: The performance of a photovoltaic (PV) panel is affected by its orientation and its tilt angle with the horizontal plane. This is because both of these parameters change the amount of solar energy received by the surface of the PV panel. A mathematical model was used to estimate the total solar radiation on the tilted PV surface, and to determine optimum tilt angles for a PV panel installed in Sanliurfa, Turkey. The optimum tilt angles were determined by searching for the values of angles for which the total radiation on the PV surface was maximum for the period studied. The study also investigated the effect of two-axis solar tracking on energy gain compared to a fixed PV panel. This study determined that the monthly optimum tilt angle for a PV panel changes throughout the year with its minimum value as 13 in June and maximum value as 61 in December. The results showed that the gains in the amount of solar radiation throughout the year received by the PV panel mounted at monthly optimum tilt angles with respect to seasonal optimum angles and tilt angel equal to latitude were 1.1% and 3.9%, respectively. Furthermore, daily average of 29.3% gain in total solar radiation results in an daily average of 34.6% gain in generated power with two-axis solar tracking compared to a south facing PV panel fixed at 14 tilt angle on a particular day in July in Sanliurfa, Turkey. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of different drip irrigation regimes on watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)] yield and yield components under semi-arid climatic conditions. Australian Journal of Agricultural Research, 55(11), 1149-1157.More infoAbstract: This study was conducted to investigate the effects of drip irrigation on yield and yield components of watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Crimson Tide F1] under semiarid conditions in the Southeastern Anatolian Project Region, Harran Plain, anliurfa, Turkey, during 2002 and 2003. Using a 4-day irrigation period, 4 different irrigation regimes were applied as ratios of irrigation water/cumulative pan evaporation (IW/CPE): 1.25 (I 125), 1.00 (I100), 0.75 (I75), and 0.50 (I 50). Seasonal crop evapotranspiration (ETc.) rates were 720, 677, 554, and 449 mm in the first year and 677, 617, 519, and 417 mm in the second year for irrigation treatments I125, I100, I 75, and I50, respectively. Amounts of irrigation water applied to the 4 respective treatments were 764, 642, 520, and 398 mm in 2002 and 709, 591, 473, and 355 mm in 2003. Maximum yield was obtained from I 125, with 84.1 t/ha in 2002 and 88.6 t/ha in 2003. Yield was reduced significantly as the irrigation water was reduced. The values of water use efficiency ranged from 9.6 to 11.7 kg/m3 in 2002 and 10.8 to 13.1 kg/m3 in 2003. The unstressed I125 treatment produced 10.1 kg marketable watermelons/m3 irrigation in 2002, and 11.3 kg/m 3 in 2003. By comparison, the least irrigated (I50) treatment produced 12.4 kg/m3 in 2002, and 14.9 kg/m3 in 2003. A yield response factor (ky) value of 1.15 was determined based on averages of 2 years, and watermelon was found to be sensitive to water stress. This result showed that yield loss (1 - Ya/Ym) is more important than evapotranspiration deficit (1 - ETa/ET m). The study demonstrates that 1.25 IW/CPE water applications by a drip system in a 4-day irrigation frequency might be optimal for watermelon grown in semi-arid regions similar to those in which the work was conducted.Kacira, M., Ling, P.

Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers, 45(3), 775-780.More infoAbstract: Early, non-contact, non-destructive, and quantitative detection of plant water stress with the application of infrared thermometry using a crop water stress index (CWSI) was established. A CWSI model for plants grown under controlled environments was developed using thermodynamic principles and energy balance of the plant. CWSI threshold values were established with a parametric approach. The effectiveness of the sensing technique was evaluated using timing of the stress detection by a grower. The CWSI-based technique was able to detect the stress one to two days prior to the time of stress detection by visual observation. Overall results of this study suggested that pre-visual and non-contact detection of plant water stress with infrared thermometry application using CWSI is feasible.Kacira, M., Ling, P.

A CFD evaluation of naturally ventilated, multi-span, sawtooth greenhouses. Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers, 41(3), 833-836.More infoAbstract: A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program, Fluent V4, was used to predict natural ventilation rates and airflow patterns of a multi-span sawtooth greenhouse for various roof and side vent openings and outside wind speeds. Predicted rates were found to be both well above and well below a standard volumetric air exchange rate of l.0 A.C. min-1. The maximum and most acceptable ventilation rates were obtained with the combined use of a windward side vent and leeward roof vents on all multi-span sections. Ventilation rates ranged from 1.4 to 4.01 A.C. min-1 for the best two-span case and 0.14 to 2.0 A.C. min-1 for the similar four-span case for outside wind speeds of 0. 5 and 2.0 m s-1, respectively. Predicted ventilation rates ranged from 0.17 to 0.7 A.C. min-1 when no side vent was used and the roof vents were fully open.Kacira, M., Short, T. H., & Stowell, R. R. (1997).

Paper - American Society of Agricultural Engineers, 3.More infoAbstract: A computer simulation program, FLUENT V4, was used to determine ventilation rates and air flow patterns of a multi-span sawtooth greenhouse under various roof and side vent opening configurations and outside wind speeds. The analytical method used was based on computational aerodynamics. The combined effects of roof and windward side openings resulted in ventilation rates up to four times recommended for average wind speeds. The method and the software used adequately simulated previous wind tunnel and computational studies of natural ventilation designs and the results of multi-span sawtooth simulations exceeded the recommended ventilation rates found in the literature.Proceedings PublicationsGiacomelli, G., Jensen, M., Kacira, M., & Kubota, C.
