University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, 2003 Research Interests: Biological fluid mechanics, specifically fish swimming Fluid structure interactions Vortex dynamics Turbulence Turbulent combustion Current Research: Professor Greens research interests include vortex-dominated wakes generated by swimming offlying of animals and the coherent structure composition of reacting and non-reacting turbulent flow fields. Increased understanding of how these flows are organized can lead to advances in basic research, model development for flow simulation, dynamics and control plus improvements in existing technology. In order to investigate these flows, Dr. Green integrates quantitative and qualitative experimental techniques with comprehensive data analysis such as Lagrangian coherent structures identification.
