She also is involved in developing a PhD in Health Informatics programincorporating expertise from the two colleges. She founded and directs the Communication Analysis and Design Laboratory (CadLab). The mission of this interdisciplinary lab is to conduct research along two main themes: analysis of spoken communication and the design, development and assessment of novel assistive human-machine interfaces. Current research projects include prosodic (melodic) analysis of impaired speech for developing voice-driven assistive communication aids, studying the effects of pitch and loudness perturbations on speech production, developing interactive software for teaching children how to read aloud with inflection, and designing and implementing novel brain-computer interfaces, Students from speech and hearing sciences, electrical engineering and computer science work collaboratively in the CadLab, a state-of-the-art facility for conducting psychoacoustic studies, software design and prototyping, and usability testing.
