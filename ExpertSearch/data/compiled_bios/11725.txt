Using a combination of nonlinear systems theory, stochastic differential equations, and information theory I study this problem in the context of somatosensory, auditory, and electrosensory systems. The main goal is to link brain dynamics responsible for coding with putative coding schemes that may be general across many sensory systems. Of particular interest is how correlations and synchrony across a population of thalamic and cortical neurons influences the information throughput of sensory processing.
