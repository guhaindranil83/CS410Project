Faculty Bud Mishra , Ph.D. Professor and Director of Bioinformatics Mathematics Connect Bud Mishra is a professor of computer science and mathematics at NYU's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, professor of human genetics at Mt Sinai School of Medicine, and a professor of cell biology at NYU School of Medicine. Bud has a degree in Sciences from Utkal University, in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, and MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from Carnegie-Mellon University. Bud is also a visiting scholar at CSHL's Center for Quantitative Biology. From 2001-04, he was a professor at the Watson School of Biological Sciences, Cold Spring Harbor Lab (CSHL) and from 2003-2006, a Visiting Professor at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). Bud is an IIT, Kharagpur Distinguished Alumnus, NYSTAR Distinguished Professor, AAAS Fellow (engineering: robotics, hardware verification and computational biology), IEEE fellow (robotics and automation) and a fellow of the ACM (computational biology and symbolic computation). His other research activities, outside of computational and systems biology, take place in the newly created Laboratory for Entrepreneurship in Data Sciences (LEDS) focusing on challenges from Finance, Advertising and Ad Technology, Philanthropy, Biomedicine and Engineering. Somewhat immodestly (and with apologies to Albert Arnold "Al" Gore), the laboratory aims to reinvent the Internet of the future.
