McAdam Professor of Heart Assist Technology Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering Weill Hall, Room 109 607-255-0726antaki@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyThe majority of Prof. Antaki'sprofessional career has been devoted to development of blood-wetted medical devices. His research focuses on the methodology by which these devices aredesignedand used clinically. His group was one of the pioneers in physiological feedback control of implanted ventricular assist devices, and also developed one of the first decision support programs for identifying heart failure patients who could potentially recover with the acute mechanical circulatory assistance. Over the past 24 years, Antaki hascontributed to the development of several heart-assist devices used clinically, including the Heartmate-II, Novacor, Ventracor, TandemHeart, and Levacor. In 1997, he directed a multidisciplinary team that produced the Streamliner heart-assist device - the world's first magnetically levitated rotodynamic blood pump to be tested in-vivo. The current emphasis of Prof. Antaki's research involves five application areas: circulatory support systems for children, decision-support tools for severe heart failure, diagnostic technology for the home and point-of-care to improve patient engagement, multi-scale modeling of thrombosis in artificial circulation, and development of medical devices for global health. A nascent, overarching project aims to accelerate medical innovation by professional networking between physicians, medical product designers, and patients. Although theseinterests and experiences are diverse, they share a common theme of improving healthcare though biomedical engineering.Research InterestsBiomedical EngineeringBioengineeringBiomechanics and MechanobiologyBiomedical Imaging and InstrumentationSystems and Synthetic BiologySelected PublicationsAntaki, J F., R Wampler.2012."The Future of Mechanical Circulatory Support."In Mechanical Circulatory Support: A Companion to Braunwald's Heart Disease, edited by RL Kormos & L Miller, 333-335.Antaki, James, M R.
