University of South Florida (2010) B.S. St. Cyril and Methodius University, Republic of Macedonia (2005) Courses Taught College Physics I and II, College Physics I and II Laboratories, University Physics, Modern Physics Laboratory, Classical Thermodynamics, Physical Chemistry Laboratory Research Areas Photovoltaics, Batteries, Renewable Energy, Thermoelectricity Current Research Projects Project 1: Batteries for biomedical applications Batteries can be used as power sources for motorized wheelchairs, surgical tools, cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators, dynamic prostheses, sensors and monitors for physiological parameters, neurostimulators, devices for pain relief, iontophoresis, electroporation, and related devices for drug administration. Students investigate the types of battery chemistries used for biomedical applications and test their properties by using instrumentals such as potentiostats/galvanostats. Project 2: Batteries for electric vehicles This project involves testing of batteries for electric (EV) or hybrid-electric (HEV) vehicles. Although the testing of batteries is on a laboratory-scale, the project is intended to mimic the activities of engineers in companies and national laboratories designing batteries for EVs. Properties such as battery capacity, voltage and current during charging and discharging, are investigated. The effects of temperature and mechanical stresses on the performance of the battery are analyzed. Impedance Spectroscopy is employed to measure properties such as internal resistance in order to assess the state of health of energy storage systems. Project 3: Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) This is one of the latest promising solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies, focused on the design of solar cells that are light, inexpensive, transparent, and have the potential of achieving desirable efficiencies. The DSSCs are assembled and their electrochemical properties measured. The investigation is aimed toward identifying inexpensive and abundant dyes which allow for an efficient solar-to-electrical energy conversion. Project 4: Standalone solar PV system for health clinics or schools in remote areas The project focuses on designing solar PV systems for health clinics or schools in remote areas, where no alternative sources of power are available. The project encompasses understanding of the operation and properties of solar cells, the components of solar PV systems (solar panels, batteries, inverters, charge controllers, etc.), and incorporating them into a final design. This project is suitable for students across a range of disciplines and majors: those interested in the engineering aspects of the design, as well as those interested in the humanitarian aspect of it, for example delivering power to areas where it is either inaccessible or prohibitively expensive.
