He is also a researcher in the Waterloo Institute of Nanotechnology and the head of the Nanomechanics Research Institute. The groups research focuses on elastic constraint effects on small scale fractures in thin films, mechanical reliability of nano-scale devices, fracture of porous brittle materials used in advanced integrated circuits, and the mechanical properties of materials for lead free solder applications. Professor Tsuis group has also developed techniques to fabricate nanometer scale structures for various applications. These processing methods include plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD), e-beam lithography, and electroplating. In 2013, Professor Tsui began a research collaboration with Dr. Frank Gu, working to understand how bacterial cells interact with mental nanopillars. They aim to develop novel nanometer scale surface features that can diminish the adhesion strength between metals and bacterial cells, which can reduce the chance of infection after metal implantation surgeries. In addition to his research work, Professor Tsui holds 29 patents and has published more than 50 journal manuscripts.Research InterestsIntegrate circuitsPECVDLow-k dielectricsNanoindentationFractureSemi-conductorsNanotechnologyCeramicsAdhesionPlasma-Enhanced chemical vapor depositionPorous ultra-low-dielectric constant materialsNano-mechanicsThin film mechanical propertiesEducation1997, Doctorate, Materials Science, Rice University1992, Master's, Materials Science, Rice University1990, Bachelor's, Ceramic Engineering, Clemson UniversityCourses*CHE 121 - Engineering ComputationTaught in 2015, 2017, 2018NE 113 - Introduction to Computational MethodsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 765 - Research Topics in Biochemical EngineeringTaught in 2015NE 318 - Continuum Mechanics for Nanotechnology EngineeringTaught in 2015, 2019NE 100 - Introduction to Nanotechnology EngineeringTaught in 2015, 2018, 2019NE 401 - Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2015NE 402 - Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2016CHE 755 - Res Topics in Electrochemical Engineering, Interfacial Eng & Material ScienceTaught in 2016CHE 750 - Special Topics in Electrochemical Engineering, Interfacial Engineering & Materials ScienceTaught in 2017NE 302 - Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2017NE 125 - Introduction to Materials Science and EngineeringTaught in 2018* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsSeo, Brandon B and Gu, Junhua and Jahed, Zeinab and Tsui, Ting Y, Influence of grain boundary modifier on the strength size-dependence displayed by complex-shaped nanocrystalline nickel pillars, Thin Solid Films, 621, 2017, 178 - 183Jahed, Zeinab and Shahsavan, Hamed and Verma, Mohit S and Rogowski, Jacob L and Seo, Brandon B and Zhao, Boxin and Tsui, Ting Y and Gu, Frank X and Mofrad, Mohammad RK, Bacterial networks on hydrophobic micropillars, ACS nano, 11(1), 2017, 675 - 683Seo, Brandon B and Jahed, Zeinab and Coggan, Jennifer A and Chau, Yeung Yeung and Rogowski, Jacob L and Gu, Frank X and Wen, Weijia and Mofrad, Mohammad RK and Tsui, Ting Yiu, Mechanical Contact Characteristics of PC3 Human Prostate Cancer Cells on Complex-Shaped Silicon Micropillars, Materials, 10(8), 2017Moussa, Hassan I and Logan, Megan and Siow, Geoffrey C and Phann, Darron L and Rao, Zheng and Aucoin, Marc G and Tsui, Ting Y, Manipulating mammalian cell morphologies using chemical-mechanical polished integrated circuit chips, Science and Technology of advanced MaTerialS, 18(1), 2017, 839 - 856Lee, Jung-A and Lee, Dong-Hyun and Seok, Moo-Young and Choi, In-Chul and Han, Heung Nam and Tsui, Ting Y and Ramamurty, Upadrasta and Jang, Jae-il, Significant strengthening of nanocrystalline Ni sub-micron pillar by cyclic loading in elastic regime, Scripta Materialia, 140, 2017, 31 - 34 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 6(E6) Phone:519-888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Chemical Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
