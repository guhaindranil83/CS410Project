He specializes in Biochemical Engineering, particularly in cell culture engineering for the production of complex biologics: from proteins (projects have included work on myristoylated proteins, antibodies and other immune-system related proteins), to DNA, to virus-like particles, viruses and viral vectors. Professor Aucoins research work makes use of several cell culture platforms including insect (Sf9, Hi5) and mammalian cells (CHO, Vero). One aspect of Prof. Aucoin's work involves the use of 1D-1H NMR for optimizing cell culture processes. Through his work with viruses, Prof. Aucoin has also gained an interest in examining the stability of virus in complex solutions including cell culture media. This has led to collaborations with industry in the area of virus inactivation and virus control. At the University, Prof. Aucoin is the Interim Chair for Chemical Engineering. He is also a Faculty Advisor for the universitys international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition student team. Prof. Aucoin is an active member of the Centre for Bioengineering and Biotechnology and the Waterloo Centre for Microbial Research. He is also a member of the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
