He has a unique blend of work experience in both the engineering and medical fields, resulting in the licensing of ground-breaking innovations in both areas. Professor Al-Mayahs expertise spans from materials, mechanics and structural applications to biomechanics, imaging and medical physics. His research in materials is centered on the integration of imaging and mechanics for material characterization, which will target the mechanical properties of engineering materials using a new approach that merges imaging, mechanics and numerical modeling. This innovative approach will shift the mechanical characterization of materials from the conventional overall performance to a components-based evaluation. It will also transfer conventional visual image inspection to a detailed image-based mechanical analysis with stress distribution, and deformation to identify failure initiation and the role of each component on the load carrying capacity. In mechanics and structural applications, a comprehensive research program on the interfacial mechanics of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) has resulted in the design of a gripping system known as FibreLokTM that enables structural engineers to utilize full high tensile strength of FRP rods. Professor Al-Mayah is also conducting research on biomechanical properties of soft tissues and medical applications. The research focuses on the development of new minimally invasive techniques to measure in vivo, and patient-specific mechanical properties of tissues. In addition, he has applied biomechanical modeling for image guided radiotherapy of the lungs, head-and-neck, liver, prostate, and breast. This has been contributing to the accurate delivery of radiotherapy doses to the tumor while sparing healthy tissues. In conclusion, innovative research activities are under way in which engineering and medical techniques are merged to address the challenges in both fields.Research InterestsBiomechanics: Material properties and medical applicationsComposite materials: Mechanics and applicationsIntegration of imaging and mechanics for material characterizationsImage processing and data analyticsMedical imagingEducation2005, Post-doctorate, Civil/Mechanical Engineering, University of Waterloo2004, Doctorate, Civil/Mechanical Engineering, University of Waterloo1999, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo1990, Bachelor of Engineering, Civil Engineering, Basrah UniversityCourses*CIVE 205 - Solid Mechanics 2Taught in 2016, 2017CIVE 701 - Topics in MechanicsTaught in 2016, 2017CIVE 401 - Civil Engineering Design Project 2Taught in 2018CIVE 415 - Structural System DesignTaught in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019CIVE 460 - Engineering BiomechanicsTaught in 2019ME 598 - Special Topics in Mechanical EngineeringTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMohee, Faizul M and Al-Mayah, Adil and Plumtree, Alan, Friction Characteristics of CFRP Plates in Contact with Copper Plates under High Contact Pressure, Journal of Composites for Construction, 2016Shaheen, Magdy and Al-Mayah, Adil and Tighe, Susan, A novel method for evaluating hot mix asphalt fatigue damage: X-ray computed tomography, Construction and Building Materials, 113, 2016, 121 - 133Alyousef, Rayed and Topper, Tim and Al-Mayah, Adil, Fatigue Bond Stress--Slip Behavior of Lap Splices in the Reinforcement of Unwrapped and FRP-Wrapped Concrete Beams, Journal of Composites for Construction, 2016Mohee, Faizul M and Al-Mayah, Adil and Plumtree, Alan, Anchors for CFRP plates: State-of-the-art review and future potential, Composites Part B: Engineering, 90, 2016, 432 - 442Alyousef, Rayed and Topper, Tim and Al-Mayah, Adil, Effect of FRP wrapping on fatigue bond behavior of spliced concrete beams, Journal of Composites for Construction, 20(1), 2015 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
