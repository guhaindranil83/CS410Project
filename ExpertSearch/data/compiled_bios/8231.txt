He acquired his doctorate in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University in 2013. After receiving his doctorate, Robertson spent four years working overseas as a senior research scientist in the emerging area of crop biomechanics. His unique interdisciplinary research enabled him to work across numerous industries which led to his appointment as a United States Department of Agriculture NIFA-AFRI Fellow. His research eventually led Robertson to return to Idaho where he is working with local agronomists and industry partners to develop solutions to the long standing problem of stalk lodging (i.e., corn, wheat, rice, barley and canola plants breaking in wind and rain storms). In general, Robertsons teaching and research efforts are focused on using engineering principles to accomplish what the White House has called the great challenge of the 21st century: sustainably providing food, fuel and fiber for the worlds growing population. Robertsons past research projects include, characterizing soft tissue material responses, spinal biomechanics, orthopedic device design, plant biomechanics and stochastic analyses of complex computational models.
