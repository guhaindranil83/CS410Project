We have a yes, and culture, where students and faculty embrace the unknown, dream beyond what is realistic, and run headlong at a challenge. Sitting at the epicenter of research and innovation, and surrounded by some of the worlds leading hospitals and biotechnology companies, each day we passionately push the limits of science and engineering. This is the kind of place that doesnt just talk about moon shots, but helped accomplish the real thing.
