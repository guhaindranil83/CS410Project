The exploration of new approaches to probe the dynamics and the interactions of molecules within nanofluidic environments: (i) represents an important and largely unexplored regime in which interesting new physics can dominate, and (ii) enables quantitative measurements, with exceptional sensitivity, on the structure and behavior of biological molecules.
