After graduating in 1996 with a Ph.D. from McMaster University, she served as a Professor of Civil Engineering at the Universities of Kentucky, Connecticut and Vermont. Dr. Aultman-Hall focuses on transportation systems, especially methods to collect unique databases for modeling and analysis of long-distance intercity travel, transportation sector emissions, network resiliency, streetscape design, and non-motorized transportation. Dr. Aultman-Hall was the founding Director of the interdisciplinary Vermont Transportation Research Center (TRC) whose focus included land use and transportation models. She is currently active as co-leader of the Sustainable Aviation Research Collaborative at the University of California Davis. Dr. Aultman-Hall brings modeling of real-world spatial behavior to the modeling of charging demand for electric vehicles with the Joint Clean Climate Transport Research Partnership (JCCTRP) led by the University of Quebec at Montreal. Dr. Aultman-Hall's most recent journal publications have focused on creating alternative specific attributes for intercity mode choice models of air versus highway travel. She is also working on use of travel survey data to generate time and space-resolved energy demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging which is a key element of modeling regional electricity grids under different EV adoption scenarios. Dr. Aultman-Hall is currently engaged with partners at UC Davis to consider the role of racial identity in bicycling. With collaborators in Vermont, Dr. Aultman-Hall is developing new spatial accessibility measures for intercity travel using large datasets from California.Education1996, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, McMaster University1993, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, Queen's University1991, Bachelor of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, McMaster UniversitySelected/Recent PublicationsUllman*, Hannah and Lisa Aultman-Hall.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
