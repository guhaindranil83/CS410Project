Hereceived hisPh.D. fromMITin 2011. Prior to joining the MITs faculty, he spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher atMicrosoft Research New Englandand then was on the faculty ofEPFLuntil early 2015. His research focuses onalgorithmic graph theory, i.e., design and analysis of very efficient (approximation) algorithms for fundamental graph problems. He also enjoys investigating topics in combinatorial optimization especially the ones involving dealing with uncertainty. A frequent theme in hisresearch is employing a mix of linear-algebraic methods (particularly, the tools of spectral graph theory) and continuous optimization techniques to purely combinatorial problems. His PhD thesis race work theACM Doctoral Dissertation Award Honorable Mention and George M. Sprowls Award at MIT. His work has been awarded several best paper awards (SODA 2010, STOC 2011, FOCS 2011and 2013). He is also the recipient of a Sloan Fellowship in Computer Science.
