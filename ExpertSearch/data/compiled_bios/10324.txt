She conducts research in Ecological Interface Design, cognitive work analysis, and graphical interface design and visualization, which has been applied in military systems, healthcare, power plant control, and oil and gas refining. Ecological Interface Design (EID) draws design principles from both ecological psychology and engineering. The goal of EID is to present the operator with all the information needed to understand how to achieve plant goals while using a transparent interface. Experimentally, EID is showing great promise as an approach to designing interfaces for systems such as petrochemical plants, power plants and in aviation. This research aims to continue to explore this framework and expand its successful implementation to industrial situations. Professor Burns current projects include mobile decision support tools for cardiac nurses, supporting situation awareness in power plant operators, diabetes management tools, and supporting human-to-human and human-to-agent collaboration in uninhibited aerial vehicle environments. Her research is sponsored by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, Bell University Labs, Research in Motion (RIM) and NSERC. Professor Burns is the author of over 100 publications and also recently co-wrote a book on EID. She is the Program Chair for the Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making Technical Group of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society and an Associate Editor for the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies.Research InterestsHuman factors engineeringSystems engineeringSafetyErgonomicsDesign ProcessCognitive engineeringHuman errorDecision makingInterface Design and IntegrationUsability Testing and Interactive TechnologyEcological Interface DesignCognitive Work AnalysisGraphical interface design and visualizationEducation1998, Doctorate, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto1994, Master's, Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto1992, Bachelor's, Systems Design Engineering, University of WaterlooCourses*BME 162 - Human Factors in the Design of Biomedical and Health SystemsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019SYDE 642 - Cognitive Engineering MethodsTaught in 2016, 2018SYDE 542 - Interface DesignTaught in 2015, 2017SYDE 740 - Selected Topics in Human SystemsTaught in 2017* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsJatob, Alessandro and Bellas, Hugo Cesar and Bonfatti, Renato and Burns, Catherine M and Vidal, Mario Cesar R and de Carvalho, Paulo Victor R, Designing for patient risk assessment in primary health care: a case study for ergonomic work analysis, Cognition, Technology & Work, 18(1), 2016, 215 - 231Burns, Catherine M and Naikar, Neelam, Prioritization A Double-Edged Sword?, Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making, 10(1), 2016, 105 - 108Burns, Catherine M and Bisantz, Ann M, Advances in the Application of Cognitive Work Analysis, Applications of Cognitive Work Analysis, 2016Kant, Vivek and Burns, Catherine M, Engaging nanotechnology: ethnography of lab-on-a-chip technology in small-scale fluidics research, Cognition, Technology & Work, 18(1), 2016, 33 - 52Mercer, Kathryn and Li, Melissa and Giangregorio, Lora and Burns, Catherine and Grindrod, Kelly, Behavior change techniques present in wearable activity trackers: a critical analysis, JMIR mHealth and uHealth, 4(2), 2016 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
