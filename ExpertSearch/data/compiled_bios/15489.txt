Brown, we find out how faculty and students are making changes to safely re-enter their workspace. Solar-powered wastewater treatment coupled with energy and nutrient recovery01/28/2020 "Our goal is to identify solar-powered wastewater nitrate treatment pathways that facilitate the recovery of energy by producing value-added chemicals from these nutrients," said Bala Chandran. The work is funded by Bala Chandrans startup funds and MCubed, a University initiative to encourage innovative, interdisciplinary research. The project marries fundamental materials-scale catalysis, physics-based modeling, and experimental investigations. Bala Chandran's Paper Published in Energy and Environmental Science 01/31/2018 Assistant Professor Bala Chandran's research featured on inside front cover of high impact journalEnergy and Environmental Science. ME Welcomes New Faculty Members08/31/2017 The ME department is pleased to welcome Rohini Bala Chandran, Elliott Rouse and Alex Shorter who are joining the faculty as assistant professors.
