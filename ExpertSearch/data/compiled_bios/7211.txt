Dr. Romberg received the B.S.E.E. (1997), M.S. (1999) and Ph.D. (2004) degrees from Rice University in Houston, Texas. From Fall 2003 until Fall 2006, he was a Postdoctoral Scholar in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology. He spent the Summer of 2000 as a researcher at Xerox PARC, the Fall of 2003 as a visitor at the Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions in Paris, and the Fall of 2004 as a Fellow at UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics. In the Fall of 2006, he joined the Georgia Tech ECE faculty. In 2008 he received an ONR Young Investigator Award, in 2009 he received a PECASE award and a Packard Fellowship, and in 2010 he was named a Rice University Outstanding Young Engineering Alumnus. He is currently on the editorial board for the SIAM Journal on the Mathematics of Data Science, and is a Fellow of the IEEE. His research interests lie on the intersection of signal processing, machine learning, optimization, and applied probability. Research interests: Imaging inverse problems Data compression Multiscale geometrical representations Sparse approximation Distinctions: ONR Young Investigator Award, 2008 Presidential Early Career Award in Science and Engineering (PECASE), 2009 Packard Fellowship, 2009 Rice University Outstanding Young Engineering Alumnus, 2010 M.
