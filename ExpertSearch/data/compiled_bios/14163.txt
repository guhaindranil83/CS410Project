He studies both deep groundwater systems as well as interactions between groundwater, lakes and rivers on local and regional scales. His projects have included research in Finland, Canada and Greenland, as well as locally within Waterloo Region and Southern Ontario.

He has extensive experience on ongoing studies in the following areas of geochemistry. Hydrogeochemical Systems in Deep Crystalline (Granite) and Sedimentary Rocks Ongoing research in Finland, Canada and Greenland associated with the safe disposal of radioactive and other wastes. An association over the past 30 years with projects around the world has resulted in an extensive knowledge base concerned with groundwater chemistry and movement in deep hydrogeologic systems. Groundwater-Surface Water Interaction Experience as a graduate student and then over the past 30 years with problems of contaminant migration, salination and surface water management as a result of groundwater migration into surface waters such as rivers and lakes. Projects have been concerned with the natural migration of petroleum rich deep groundwaters into the Great Lakes of Canada, contaminant migration into surface water bodies from landfill sites and migration of refinery wastes into local lakes and rivers in Australia. Groundwater Resource Evaluation Local projects concerned with groundwater chemistry, age and amount in the Waterloo region and southern Ontario; coupled to extensive groundwater management projects in South America and India has provided a solid knowledge base for assessing the quality and quantity of ground and surface water systems. Teaching ProfessorFrape'scourses attract bothgeology/hydrogeologystudents and geological engineers. Many of the environmental andhydrogeologycourses he has set up have been so successful, they have continued to be offered as a permanent part of the Earth Sciences curriculum.
