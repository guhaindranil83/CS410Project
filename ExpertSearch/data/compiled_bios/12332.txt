We are currently pursuing research into the dynamics and structure of lipid membranes and the development of label-free methods for detecting protein and small-molecule adsorption to interfaces. Our laboratory uses a combination of nonlinear optical spectroscopies in conjunction with biological and electrochemical methods to achieve these objectives. Please peruse the selection of publications from our group listed below for more information about our research.
