He is interested in the fundamental problems of these aspects. For examples, his publication on elliptic curve cryptography addressed the issue of fast encryption; his work on compressed sensing provided tools for better understanding and analyzing high dimensional data. He is fascinated by the scientific work with aesthetic values and he keeps this in mind in considering strategies of formulating and solving problems. Education: Ph.
