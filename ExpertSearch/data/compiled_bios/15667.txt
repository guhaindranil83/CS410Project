Lander Professor of Biology; Professor of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School; Founding Director, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard Eric S. Lander is interested in every aspect of the human genome and its application to medicine. 617-714-7010 Phone NE30-6013 Office lander@broadinstitute.org Email Lab Website Nicole Brellenthin Assistant 617-714-7012 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1981, Oxford University AB, 1978, Mathematics, Princeton University Research Summary Following the successful completion of the Human Genome Project, the challenge now is to decipher the information encoded within the human genetic code including genes, regulatory controls and cellular circuitry. Such understanding is fundamental to the study of physiology in both health and disease. At the Broad Institute, my lab collaborates with other to discover and understand the genes responsible for rare genetic diseases, common diseases, and cancer; the genetic variation and evolution of the human genome; the basis of gene regulation via enhancers, long non-coding RNAs, and three-dimensional folding of the genome; the developmental trajectories of cellular differentiation; and the history of the human population.
