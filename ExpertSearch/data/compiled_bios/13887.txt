David grew up in Vancouver, British Columbia and completed his undergraduate degree at Simon Fraser University in 2002. For graduate school, he attended the University of Toronto and was awarded his PhD in chemistry in 2007. His research during this period focused on the synthesis and self-assembly of organometallic polymers. In the summer of 2007, David began a postdoctoral position at Canadas National Institute for Nanotechnology in Edmonton, Alberta and began investigating conducting polymers and nanostructured electrodes for plastic solar panels. David came to WWU as a member the Advanced Materials Science and Engineering Center (AMSEC) and is alwayseager to contribute to its role in educating students and driving interdisciplinary research. Davidteaches classes in general chemistry and plastics & composites engineering as well as courses in the material science minor offered by AMSEC.
