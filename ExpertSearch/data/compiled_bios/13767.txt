We develop models for physical processes that determine how vegetated habitats (green infrastructure), such as seagrasses, salt marsh, and mangroves, provide coastal protection, mitigate anthropogenic nutrient and pollutant loads, and provide blue carbon reservoirs, with the goal of applying these models to improve the management of natural resources and the design of green infrastructure. Teaching Interests Fluid mechanics, surface water transport processes, physical limnology. Selected Publications For selected publications please visit Professor Nepfs home page.
