From 1983 to 1985, I was an EMC engineer with Xerox Corporation in El Segundo, CA where I performed electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) design and testing of printer and copier products.I was an RF/microwave engineer with the Hughes Aircraft Company in 1985, working on the vehicular JTIDS radio program, and then with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory from 1985 to 1991 in Pasadena, CA.There I worked on the receiver and exciter subsystems of the Deep Space Networks of NASA.This included developing low noise, high frequency stability S- and X-band test signal generators for the Radio Science experiments during the Neptune encounter of the Voyager II spacecraft. From 1991 to 1996, I was an electronics engineer/program manager with the Space Vehicle Directorate at the USAF Phillips Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM. Since 1996, I have been an assistant professor in the Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.My current research interests are in RF and optical communications, application of spread spectrum to wireless and fiber optic communications, signal processing and transform techniques.
