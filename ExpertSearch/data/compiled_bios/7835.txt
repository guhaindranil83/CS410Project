Gabrielle obtained a PhD in computational astrophysics from Cardiff University in 1993, following an undergraduate degree in mathematics at Nottingham University and a Masters of Advanced Study in Mathematics from Cambridge University. Gabrielle has been a research scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (AEI) in Potsdam Germany, where she researched and developed techniques for high performance and grid computing. At the AEI Gabrielle led the Cactus Code Project, and had leadership roles in collaborative European projects GridLab and the EU Astrophysics Network. Gabrielle then moved to Louisiana State University in 2003 as an assistant professor of computer science and physics, and a founding member of the new Center for Computation and Technology where she served as the Assistant Director for Computing Applications. At LSU Gabrielle led the cyberinfrastucture component of the statewide NSF research infrastructure improvement award "CyberTools", and was involved in a number of large, collaborative projects involving computer science, scientific computing and the computational sciences, in diverse fields including petroleum engineering, coastal modeling, computational fluid dynamics, numerical relativity, computational chemistry and computational biology. Between 2010 and 2012 Gabrielle served as a Program Director in the Office ofCyberinfrastructure at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Washington DC.At NSF, Gabrielle developed NSF-wide programs in software and computational anddata-enabled science, and within OCI was responsible for learning and workforcedevelopment activities including CAREER, REU and the CI-TRACS postdoctoralfellowship program. In 2012, Gabrielle moved to Moscow, Russia to become a professor at a new graduate university - the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) - established by the Russian Federation in partnership with MIT. Here, she worked primarily on establishing the IT and cyberinfrastructure vision for Skoltech as the interim Chief Information Officer. In Spring 2014 Gabrielle moved to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign as the Associate Director for Research and Education Programs at NCSA, in Fall 2016 she assumed the Associate Dean for Research role in the College of Education.
