Wysocki Dr Tadeusz Wysockireceived the M.Eng.Sc degree with the highest distinction in telecommunicationsfrom the Academy of Technology and Agriculture, Bydgoszcz, Poland, in 1981. From then till the end of1991, he was with the Academy of Technology and Agriculture. In 1984, after three years of research inthe area of modulation theory, he received his Ph.D. degree,summa cum laude, from theWarsawUniversity of Technology.He then continued research into combined modulation and coding and in1990, he was awarded the D.Sc. degree (Habilitation) in telecommunications engineering from theWarsaw University of Technology. In January 1992, he moved to Perth, Western Australia to work atEdith Cowan University Joondalup Campus where he was invited to join a group to bid for funding toestablish a Cooperative Research Centre for Broadband Telecommunications and Networking. In 1993,he was a visiting senior research fellow atFernUniversitt in Hagen,Germany, within the framework ofanAlexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship. The research involved working on coded modulationsand problems related to mobile telephony. On his return to Perth in 1994, he was appointed ProjectLeader, Wireless ATM LANs, at the CRC for Broadband Telecommunications and Networking, and the manager of the CRC-BTN node at Edith Cowan University. After a restructure of the CRC in 1997, hewas given the position of Program Leader, Wireless Systems, maintaining his leadership in the Wireless ATM LAN project. In December 1998, he joined theUniversity of Wollongongas an associate professor,and in August 1999 he assumed a position of Research Coordinator for the Switched NetworksResearch Centre within the Telecommunications &amp; Information Technology Research Institute(TITR).In 2003, he established the Wireless Research Group in TITR, which he directed until the end of2007, when he moved to take up a Professorship of Computer and Electronics Engineering atPeterKiewit Instituteat theUniversity of Nebraska - Lincoln. Dr Wysocki is the author or co-author of seven books, over 230 research publications and nine patents. His main areas of research interest are:molecular communications, indoor propagation of microwaves, signal processing for communicationsystems, modeling biological processes at nano-scale. He is a Senior Member of IEEE, a member of theAustralian Association of von Humboldt Fellows, and an associate editor of Computers and ElectricalEngineering Journal. He also served as an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theoryand Techniques. Since 2011, Dr. Wysocki has been a member of the UNL Senate Executive Committee.In 2013, he was awarded a "Professor of Poland" title conferred by thePresident of Poland,BronisawKomorowskion October 30, 2013.
