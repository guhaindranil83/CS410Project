His research interests span network and software security, Internet measurements, and human factors in security, with a particular focus on improving security operations in practice. This work has led to top-tier conference publications, as well as Best Paper Awards at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC14) and the USENIX Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS19). Before joining the Georgia Tech ECE faculty, he currently serves as a Visiting Researcher at Facebook. He received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley (2019) and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT (2013). During his graduate studies, he was supported by NSF GRFP and NDSEG fellowships, and received the Berkeley Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award. He hails originally from Minnesota and remains an ardent (yet often disappointed) fan of the Vikings and Timberwolves.
