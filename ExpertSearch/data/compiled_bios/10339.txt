Her research focuses on problems of biocompatibility with biomaterials and biomedical devices. While biomedical devices have significantly improved quality of life and increased life expectancy of millions of people, their use is not without complications such as infection, thrombosis and fibrosis. Although the overall rate of complications remains low, the consequences may have fatal outcomes. Research in Professor Gorbets lab aims to understand interactions between biomaterials and biological systems. A better understanding of the mechanisms of material-induced cellular activation will enable the design of materials and/or therapeutic strategies that improve biocompatibility and will hence reduce the risks of complications. Some of her research currently focuses on the mechanisms of material-induced thrombosis (blood clot formation) with mechanical heart valves and coronary stents. In-vitro models are being developed to characterize how the blood system (platelets, leukocytes and proteins) interacts with medical-grade metals to create a prothrombotic state. These results will later be used to develop in-silico thrombosis models. Professor Gorbet is also interested in the development of better in-vitro models that can help understand and solve material biocompatibility problems. These in-vitro models are used to identify the interactions between the material and biological systems and test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of these interactions. These findings can then be verified in-vivo or in clinical settings. Ophthalmic biomaterials, such as soft contact lenses and keratoprosthesis, are currently the main focus of this research.Research Interestsbiocompatibilitybiomedical devicesbiomaterialsBiological Response to MaterialsErgonomicsHuman Factors & BiomedicalEducation2001, Doctorate, PhD, University of Toronto1995, Master's, MASc, University of Toronto1993, Bachelor's, BASc, Universite de Technologie de CompiegneCourses*BME 102 - SeminarTaught in 2015BME 101 - Communications in Biomedical Engineering-Written and OralTaught in 2015BME 202 - SeminarTaught in 2016BME 284 - Physiological and Biological SystemsTaught in 2016BME 301 - SeminarTaught in 2017SYDE 285 - Materials ChemistryTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017BME 161 - Introduction to Biomedical DesignTaught in 2015, 2017BME 201 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2017BME 302 - SeminarTaught in 2017BME 362 - Biomedical Engineering Design Workshop 1Taught in 2017BME 361 - Biomedical Engineering DesignTaught in 2017, 2018BME 399 - Directed Biomedical Research ProjectTaught in 2019BME 499 - Elective Biomedical Research ProjectTaught in 2019SYDE 384 - Biological and Human SystemsTaught in 2019SYDE 780 - Selected Topics in Engineering SciencesTaught in 2015, 2018, 2019SYDE 684 - Materials BiocompatibilityTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMolladavoodi, Sara and Kwon, Hyock-Ju and Medley, John and Gorbet, Maud, Human corneal epithelial cell response to substrate stiffness, Acta biomaterialia, 11, 2015, 324 - 332Gorbet, Maud and Postnikoff, Cameron and Williams, Sara, The Noninflammatory Phenotype of Neutrophils From the Closed-Eye Environment: A Flow Cytometry Analysis of Receptor ExpressionNoninflammatory Phenotype of Tear Film Neutrophils, Investigative ophthalmology & visual science, 56(8), 2015, 4582 - 4591Gorbet, Maud and Willcox, Mark DP, Interactions of tear-film neutrophils with clinical bacteria., Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, 56(7), 2015, 4048 - 4048Wong, Alexander and Wang, Xiao Yu and Gorbet, Maud, Bayesian-based deconvolution fluorescence microscopy using dynamically updated nonstationary expectation estimates, Scientific reports, 5, 2015Kazemzadeh, Farnoud and Jin, Chao and Molladavoodi, Sara and Mei, Yu and Emelko, Monica B and Gorbet, Maud B and Wong, Alexander, Lens-free spectral light-field fusion microscopy for contrast-and resolution-enhanced imaging of biological specimens, Optics letters, 40(16), 2015, 3862 - 3865 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
