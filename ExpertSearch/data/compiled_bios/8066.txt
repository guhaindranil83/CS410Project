Zachary; Lynch, Kevin M, Dynamic in-hand sliding manipulation, IROS Hamburg 2015 - Conference DigestIn the Classroom Professor Lynch has developed the course ME 333 Introduction to Mechatronics to teach students the interdisciplinary fundamentals of interfacing sensors and actuators with a computer. The course attracts students from mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, biomedical engineering, and other fields. Professor Lynch has also constructed the undergraduate Mechatronics Design Laboratory to support student projects in the design and construction of microprocessor-controlled electromechanical systems. This laboratory supports ME 333 as well as other courses, including ME 224 Experimental Engineering, projects in Engineering Design and Communication, the annual Robot Design Competition (DC), and independent projects. Professor Lynch has also developed the new graduate courses ME 449 Robotic Manipulation and ME 450 Geometry in Robotics.
