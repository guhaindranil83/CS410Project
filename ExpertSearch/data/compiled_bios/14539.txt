Tam is a Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and a University Research Chair at the University of Waterloo. His research focuses on the microscopic and macroscopic properties of nanomaterials, self-assembly systems such as surfactants, block copolymers, and associative polymers. The scope of his work includes polymer synthesis using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), physical characterization using light scattering (static and dynamic), rheometry, and calorimetry (ITC and DSC). Professor Tam aims to correlate the polymer architecture to the microscopic and macroscopic properties of novel self-assembly systems. The potential applications of his research are in water purification, oil and gas, bio and chemical separations, personal and home care products and environmentally friendly coating systems. Professor Tam is also conducting research on the field of sustainable nano materials from renewable resources. In collaboration with Celluforce Inc., a company that operates the first cellulose nanocrystals pilot plant production facility, he aims to functionalize cellulose nanocrystals for water treatment, cosmetics, personal care, coatings and food, among other purposes. In recognition of his research work, Professor Tam was presented with the Harold Jan Shoemaker Award for the best paper published in the Journal of Hydraulic Research between 1990 and 1992. Additionally in 2005, Professor Tam was the recipient of the Tan Chin Tuan Fellowship from the Physical Chemistry Division at Lund University in Sweden.Research InterestsBiochemical & Biomedicalenhanced drug delivery systemsPolymer ScienceNanotechnologyWater-soluble fullerene systemsResponsive self-assembly systemsMagnetic nanoparticles for separation processesAtom transfer radical polymerizationStimuli responsive polymeric systemsInterfacial PhenomenaColloids & Porous MediaSustainable NanomaterialsAssociative polymers for environmentally friendly coatingsMagnetic nanoparticles for novel separation processesCellulose nanocrystalsPolymer-surfactant interactionsAdditive ManufacturingWaterSeparation ProcessesEducation1991, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, Monash University1982, Bachelor's, Chemical Engineering, Monash UniversityCourses*NANO 701 - Fundamentals of NanotechnologyTaught in 2015, 2016NANO 702 - Nanotechnology ToolsTaught in 2015, 2016CHE 100 - Chemical Engineering Concepts 1Taught in 2017, 2018, 2019NE 335 - Soft NanomaterialsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 745 - Research Topics in Polymer Science and EngineeringTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsZhang, Zhen and Sbe, Gilles and Wang, Xiaosong and Tam, Kam C, Gold nanoparticles stabilized by poly (4-vinylpyridine) grafted cellulose nanocrystals as efficient and recyclable catalysts, Carbohydrate polymers, 182, 2018, 61 - 68Wu, Yun and Lin, Zhi Yuan William and Wenger, Andrew C and Tam, Kam C and Tang, Xiaowu Shirley, 3D bioprinting of liver-mimetic construct with alginate/cellulose nanocrystal hybrid bioink, Bioprinting, 9, 2018, 1 - 6Islam, Shahid and Chen, Li and Sisler, Jared and Tam, Kam C, Cellulose Nanocrystal (CNC)--Inorganic Hybrid Systems: Synthesis, Properties and Applications, Journal of Materials Chemistry B, 6, 2018, 864 - 883Mohammed N., Grishkewich, N., Tam, K.C., Cellulose Nanomaterials: Promising Sustainable Nanomaterials for Water Treatment Applications, Environmental Science: Nano (Accepted in 2018)Zhang, Z., Tam, K.C., Wang, X.S., Sbe, G., Inverse Pickering Emulsions Stabilized by Cinnamate Modified Cellulose Nanocrystals as Templates to Prepare Silica Colloidosomes, ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering (Accepted in 2018)Peng,P.L., Tang, R., Luo, J.H., Wang, P.M., Ding, P., Tam, K.C., Applications of Nanotechnology in Oil and Gas Industry: Progress and Perspective, Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 96, 2018, 91 - 100Zhang, Z., Sbe, G., Wang, X.S., Tam, K.C.,, Enhanced Thermal Stability and UV Resistance of Poly(vinyl chloride) Reinforced by UV-absorbing Cellulose Nanocrystals, ACS Applied Nano Materials, 6(2), 2018, 2583 - 2590Tian, Y and Grishkewich, N and Bromberg, L and Hatton, T Alan and Tam, Kam C, Cross-linked Pluronic-g-Polyacrylic acid microgel system for the controlled release of doxorubicin in pharmaceutical formulations, European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics, 114, 2017, 230 - 238Zhao, Feiping and Repo, Eveliina and Song, Yang and Yin, Dulin and Hammouda, Samia Ben and Chen, Li and Kalliola, Simo and Tang, Juntao and Tam, Kam C and Sillanp, Mika, Polyethylenimine-cross-linked cellulose nanocrystals for highly efficient recovery of rare earth elements from water and a mechanism study, Green Chemistry, 19(20), 2017, 4816 - 4828In the NewsResearcher wins $800K in support for COVID project TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 6(E6) Phone:519-888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Chemical Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
