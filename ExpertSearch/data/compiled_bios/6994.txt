Fox Faculty Adjunct Professor of Applied Physics Group Leader, Accelerator Technology Research Stanford Linear Accelerator Center Sites Stanford ProfileResearch Group WebsiteResearch Areas:Accelerator & Ultrafast PhysicsDescription of Interests: Stanford University research areas center on optimal control methods to improve energy efficiency and resource allocation in plug-in hybrid vehicles. Stanford graduate courses taught in laboratory techniques and electronic instrumentation. Undergraduate seminar course "Energy Choices for the 21st Century". Energy Interests include activity through the Precourt Center and undergraduate research projects. Education interests center on innovative hands-on laboratory courses for graduates and undergraduates. Accelerator Physics research areas center on RF systems and beam dynamics, instability control for particle accelerators, technology development for beam instrumentation. Current activity focuses on beam instabilities in the proposed Electron-Ion Collider and mitigation via low level RF system feedback methods.
