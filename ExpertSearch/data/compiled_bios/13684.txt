Huck is a Professor and NSERC Chair holder in Water Treatment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Waterloo. As Chair holder, Professor Huck provides leadership to a team of professionals and graduate students conducting leading edge research in various areas related to water treatment; and also teaches courses in water treatment and related topics. He leads a team whose research focuses on risk-based decision making, which will develop tools that utilities can use for assessing and quantifying treatment in terms of identified health risks. There is also a focus on understanding and optimizing bio filtration, membrane filtration, chemical contaminant removal, and conventional treatment performance. The teams final goal is to investigate potential applications and strategies for municipal water re-use. Professor Huck has over 30 years of experience in directing research related to drinking water treatment, including several major studies for the Water Research Foundation. He also has more than 100 refereed publications and several hundred conference proceeding papers. In May 2004, Professor Huck was appointed by the Ontario Minister of the Environment to the Advisory Council on Drinking Water Standards and Testing and has been reappointed, most recently in June 2008. As a result of his research work, he has received several publication awards from the American Water Works Association (AWWA) including the 2008 A.P. Black Research Award, making him the first non-American recipient of that award. He received the George Warren Fuller Award from the Ontario Water Works Association in 2007 and also received the Albert E. Berry Medal from the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers. Additionally, Professor Huck received the Aquarina Award from the Polish Association of Sanitary Engineers for his research in the field of Natural Environmental Protection. Peter Huck is a member of the Waterloo Centre for Microbial Research.Research Interestsadvanced oxidationbiofiltrationDrinking and waste water treatmentendocrine disrupting compoundsmembrane filtrationmembrane foulingpathogenspharmaceuticalsultraviolet lightEnvironmental & Water Resourceswater supply systemsidentification and removal of trace chemical contaminantsEducation1977, Doctorate, PhD, McMaster University1973, Master's, MASc, University of Waterloo1971, Bachelor's, BASc, University of WaterlooCourses*CIVE 770 - Topics in Environmental EngineeringTaught in 2016ENVE 375 - Physico-Chemical ProcessesTaught in 2015, 2017, 2018CIVE 671 - Aquatic ChemistryTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CIVE 670 - Physico-Chemical Processes of Water and Wastewater TreatmentTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent Publications"Anatoxin-a Adsorption by Virgin and Preloaded Granular Activated Carbon.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
