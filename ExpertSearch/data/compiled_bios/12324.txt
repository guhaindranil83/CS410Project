These molecules, known as natural products or secondary/specialized metabolites, form the basis of many compounds essential to medicine and agriculture. We use underexplored bacterial communities as new sources of natural products, and to provide biological context in order to activate the production and determine the biological function of these compounds. Core research topics: Bacterial interactions mediated by natural products (chemical ecology) Isolation, structural elucidation, and biosynthesis of novel natural products Bacterial genetics and regulation of biosynthetic gene clusters Selected Publications: Puri AW, Liu D, Schaefer AL, Yu Z, Pesesky MW, Greenberg EP, & Lidstrom ME.
