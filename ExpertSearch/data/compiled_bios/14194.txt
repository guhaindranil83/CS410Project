Specific interests include hydrogeophysical characterization and monitoring of groundwater process dynamics and their importance in regional flow systems. Recently, he is exploring surface and airborne geophysical techniques that support regional-scale groundwater resource characterizations, and how these styles of data can be integrated into conventional groundwater monitoring strategies.

His research utilizes a combination of field-based geophysical, hydrogeological, and geological information in the context of local to regional-scale groundwater flow systems to better understand the complex relationship between anthropogenic and natural groundwater processes within the Earths critical zone.
