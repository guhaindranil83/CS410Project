Shiakolas. Dr. Shiakolas was born and raised in Zodia, a small town in the island nation of Cyprus, until the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 during which his family became refugees. The family moved around the government controlled part of Cyprus and eventually settled in Nicosia, the capitol of Cyprus. After completing high school at the Kykko Lyceum for Boys, he attended the Higher Technical Institute in Nicosia, Cyprus where he obtained the Higher National Diploma in Mechanical Engineering. Subsequently, he joined the National Guard of Cyprus for his military service where he served as a sergeant and honorably discharged in 1984. He joined the University of Texas at Austin in 1984 where he earned the BS and MS degrees in 1986 and 1988 respectively. He then joined The University of Texas at Arlington where he earned the PhD degree in 1992. All his degrees were in Mechanical Engineering in the areas of robotics and computer aided design. He worked as a Faculty-Research Associate at The University of Texas at Arlington from 1993 through 1996. He joined the faculty as assistant professor in 1996 and is currently tenured Associate Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington. Dr. Shiakolas' research interests are in the generals areas of robotics, manufacturing, microsystems, automation and controls as they apply to the betterment of society currently focusing in the medical - biomedica fields. In addition to his research interests, he is passionate about engineering education where he is firm believer that laying the correct foundations early in a student's carreer, both undergraduate and graduate are very important, and in addtion that theoretical frameworks should be demonstrated with hardware modules for better understanding. He has developed educational testbeds and routinely demonstrates concepts in his courses in the areas of robotics, automation, and controls Education Education 1992 PhD in Mechanical Engineering The University of Texas at Arlington, 1992 1988 MS in Mechanical Engineering The University of Texas at Austin, 1988 1986 BS in Mechanical Engineering The University of Texas at Austin, 1986 1982 Array in Mechanical Engineering Higher Technical Institute, Nicosia, Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus, 1982 Appointments Appointments Jan 2003to Present Associate Professor Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department,, The University of Texas at Arlington Jan 2003to Present Associate Professor The University of Texas at Arlington Jan 1996to 2003 Assistant Professor The University of Texas at Arlington Jan 1996to 2003 Assistant Professor The University of Texas at Arlington Jan 1993to 1996 Faculty Associate The University of Texas at Arlington Jan 1993to 1996 Faculty Associate The University of Texas at Arlington Jan 1989to 1992 Graduate Teaching Assistant The University of Texas at Arlington Jan 1986to 1988 Graduate Teaching and Research Assistant Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin Jan 1986to 1988 Graduate Teaching Assistant The University of Texas at Austin Awards and Honors Jan 2013 Honorable Mention sponsored by UTA ACES Jan 2011 Materials Foundation Undergraduate Design sponsored by ASM Jan 2007 Research Excellence Award sponsored by The University of Texas at Arlington Jan 2005 Research Excellence Award sponsored by The University of Texas at Arlington Jul 2000 Best Paper Award sponsored by ARRI Nov 1999 Best Industrail Report Award sponsored by ARRI Jan 1999 Sponsored Research Award sponsored by ARRI Support & Funding Support & Funding This data is entered manually by the author of the profile and may duplicate data in the Sponsored Projects section.

Sept 2001to Present Educational Lab Development MAEMeasurements II Educational lab development: Dr. Shiakolas has been given the responsibility by the department chair to modernize and redevelop this laboratory beginning in the Fall 2001 semester. He has requested and received funding towards these goals. Activities included purchasing computer systems for DAQ, developing LabVIEW programs, purchasing and interfacing various sensors, This laboratory is in a continuous improvement mode with the addition of new software/hardware tools depending on the availability of funds.In Spring 2015 mechatronics experiments using the myRIO (real time controller) from National Instruments were introduced as part of the standard experiments. In Summer 2017 a new fully digital (mechatronics) computer controlled Heat Exchanger testbed was identified, purchased and installed. This unit allows for more control of system parameters and provides the means for the students to better understand the effects of parameters on system performance.In Fall 2017 three new mechatronics testbeds were purchased and introduced as part of the standard experiments based on the NI ELVIS and Quanser modules; Mechatronic Sensors (2 modules) and Mechatronic Actuators.
