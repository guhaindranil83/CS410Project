Von Helmholtz Career Development Professor Assistant Professor, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Assistant Professor, Institute for Medical Engineering and Science Research Interests:evolutionary microbiology; computational and systems biology; public health ConnectEmail: tami@mit.edu Research Website: http://lieberman.science/ Education BA, Biological Sciences, Northwestern University, 2009 PhD, Systems Biology, Harvard University, 2014 Research InterestsProfessor Lieberman studies microbial evolution in real time, including the evolution of antibiotic resistance and evolution during infection. Her lab is interested in understanding the molecular determinants of colonization success in complex environments and enabling the precise manipulations of microbiomes in the clinic and the environment.
