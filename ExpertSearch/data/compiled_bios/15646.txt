Yaffe studies the chain of reactions that controls a cells response to stress, cell injury, and DNA damage. 617-452-2442 Phone 76-353 Office myaffe@mit.edu Email Lab Website Thomas Dietzel Assistant 617-452-2103 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1987, Case Western Reserve University; MD, 1989, Case Western Reserve University BS, 1981, Chemistry with Concentration in Solid-State and Polymer Physics, Cornell University Research Summary Our goal is to understand how signaling pathways are integrated at the molecular and systems levels to control cellular responses. We have two main focuses: First, we study signaling pathways and networks that control cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses in cancer and cancer therapy. Second, we examine the cross-talk between inflammation, cytokine signaling and cancer. Much of our work focuses on how modular protein domains and kinases work together to build molecular signaling circuits, and how this information can be used to design synergistic drug combinations for the personalized treatment of human disease.
