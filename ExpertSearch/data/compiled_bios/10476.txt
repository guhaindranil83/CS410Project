Schroeder is a Professor and the Ray and Beverly Mentzer Faculty Scholar in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. He is also an Affiliate in the Departments of Chemistry, Materials Science and Engineering, and Bioengineering, and he is a member of the Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology and the Institute for Genomic Biology in Biosystems Design. His research focuses on single molecule studies of polymer dynamics and biological systems, and his recent work has extended the field of single polymer dynamics to new materials. Professor Schroeder has been recognized by several awards, including the Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award, an NSF CAREER Award, the Arthur B. Metzner Award from the Society of Rheology, and a Packard Fellowship in Science and Engineering. Professor Schroeder joined the department in 2008. He received his B.S. (1999) in Chemical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, followed by an M.S. (2001) and Ph.D. (2004) in Chemical Engineering at Stanford University. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley.
