He teaches undergraduate classes in systems engineering, classical control theory and flight mechanics, and a senior/graduate class in flight test engineering. He retired from his first career - an aerospace engineer at Wright-Patterson AFB - in December 2011 after 34 years, specializing in aircraft flying qualities and flight controls. During that time he was lead flying qualities engineer for the development of the F-22, lead flight sciences engineer for the X-45 UCAV/J-UCAS program, lead flight systems engineer for the KC-X and T-6A/B programs and chief engineer for the Combat Systems Division. He has also worked in AFRL and in technical intelligence, as an aerodynamics and flight test engineer for Beech Aircraft, and as an instructor, a flight instructor and research test pilot for the Ohio State University. Tom has a BS in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Cincinnati (1977) and an MS in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from the Ohio State University (1983). He also has a Commercial Pilot's License with Single-Engine Land, Multi-Engine Land and Instrument Ratings. He has logged over 1,000 flight hours and has flown 50 major types of aircraft, including T-38, P-51, B-26 and Ford Tri-motor. He also has a Remote Pilot License with Small UAS rating. He is a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Experimental Aircraft Association, Warbirds of America, and is an Associate Member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. His research and teaching interests include aircraft flying qualities, air and space vehicle dynamics and controls, and air and space vehicle flight testing.Research Support Grant: #OSGC SICHOP 2017 (CubeCats Heimholtz Cage) Investigators:Black, George; McGhan, Catharine 05-08-2017 -05-07-2018 National Aeronautics and Space Administration UC CubeCats Helmholtz Cage (Jason Roll) Role:PI $4,740.00 Active Level:Federal Grant: #OSGC SICHOP 2017 (CubeCats CubSat Groundstation) Investigators:Black, George; McGhan, Catharine 05-08-2017 -05-07-2018 National Aeronautics and Space Administration UC CubeCats CubSat Groundstation (Reeve Lambert) Role:PI $1,530.00 Active Level:Federal Grant: #OSGC SICHOP_Richards_ck no.1974 Investigators:Black, George 10-01-2017 -09-30-2018 NASA Headquarters Programmable Flight Simulator for Teaching and Research Role:PI $5,000.00 Active Level:Federal Grant: #OSU 60064677 sub ODHE HABSat-1 Investigators:Beck, Richard; Black, George; Liu, Hongxing; Ma, Ou; McGhan, Catharine 04-04-2018 -06-30-2019 Ohio Department of Higher Education HABsat-1 (Harmful Algal Bloom Satellite-1) Role:Collaborator $131,083.00 Active Level:State of Ohio Grant: #N00014-18-1-2851 Investigators:Beck, Richard; Black, George; Liu, Hongxing; Ma, Ou; McGhan, Catharine 08-15-2018 -08-14-2020 Office of Naval Research HABsat-2 - Multi-resolution, radiation resistant, VNIR hyperspectral imaging 6U CubeSat Constellation for littoral ocean, Great Lakes and tributary inland water studies.
