Winner of Israels Seltner Award (1998) and the Gratz College Centennial Book Award (1998), she is presently completing a biography of Israels fourth prime minister, Golda Meir, a biography that asks how a lone woman surrounded by men makes it to the top. Among the prestigious research fellowships that Professor Lahav has earned are a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, a fellowship at the Stanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and a fellowship from the Center for Advanced Studies at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Lahav also served as a religion fellow at Boston University School of Theology (2010, 2011). Professor Lahav delivered several endowed lectures, includingthe Lapidus Lectureat Princeton University in March 2015, the Rockoff Lecture at Rutgers University in March 2017 and the Taubman Lecture at the University of California in Santa Barbara in November 2017. Known as a gifted teacher, Professor Lahav was the recipient of the BULaw Melton Prize for excellence in teaching in 2011. For her excellence in scholarship she was awarded the Life Achievement Award in Israel Studies by the Israel Studies Institute and the Association for Israel Studies in June 2017. Lahav has taught at Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, The Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in Herzlia, Oxford University and Universit Jean Moulin Lyon 3 in Lyon, France. Lahav teaches Constitutional Law, which automatically keeps your teaching fresh, she says. Each year the Court addresses new issues and revisits old ones. Thus, there is always intellectual challenge and deeper exploration. Lahav also teaches a course on the first amendment (her first love) and a seminar on the constitution and foreign affairs, a course she created especially to strengthen students knowledge of constitutional law while engaging with issues affecting the international scene.

[J.S.D. dissertation] Courses Comparative Constitutional Law (S): LAW JD 993 3 credits The seminar will explore American and Israeli constitutional and political design through a comparative lens. It will use constitutional design and fundamental constitutional principles obtaining in the U.S.A. as a platform against which Israel's constitutional system will be compared and examined. Students will get an understanding of different approaches to the implementation of political power in democratic regimes and be encouraged to assess the costs and benefits of each system. Issues to be covered include constitutional design, national identity, separation of powers, judicial review and the rule of law, political and civil rights, immigration and citizenship, national security, establishment of religion and the right to free exercise of religion. The American constitution, Israeli basic laws, American and Israeli statutory law as well as court cases will be read and compared. Secondary materials drawn from the literature of law and political science will also be assigned. Knowledge of Hebrew is not necessary. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.
