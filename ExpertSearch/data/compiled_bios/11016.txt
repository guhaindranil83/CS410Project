Pigford Fellowship, University of Delaware2004 McCabe Society, Carnegie Mellon University2003 Tau Beta Pi, Pennsylvania Gamma Chapter Research Description:Our research is devoted to the design and processing of complex fluids, especially those involving colloidal species (nanoparticles, emulsions, proteins, etc.) in self-assembling & structured liquids. Specifically, we seek to understand how well-specified mesostructure can be obtained in these fluids, and how it can be used to control the mechanical and transport properties of soft materials. Our approach involves combining experimental and theoretical tools (scattering, microscopy, rheology, statistical & colloidal thermodynamics) for multi-scale characterization and description of fluid microstructure and dynamics, ultimately to inform the molecular-level design of mesoscale structure. We have particular expertise in developing methods for in situ monitoring of fluid microstructure during processing. Current projects include the design of functional and stimuli-responsive gels and particulates for applications in biotechnology, advanced materials and energy conversion.
