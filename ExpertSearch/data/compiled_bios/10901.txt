He will start as an assistant professor in theMeinig School of Biomedical Engineeringand the lab will move to Ithacanear the end of 2020.The Cira Lab is developing technologies to enable new scales of experimental throughput and using them to untangle complex biological systems. Many biological systems involve the interaction of large numbers of different components, and many of biologys most pressing questions involve understanding properties that emerge out of this complexity. These questions include, How do combinations of different microbial species result in community stability?, How do different genetic variants combine to give resistance or susceptibility to disease?, and How do RNA expression levels give rise to different cell types?. Answering questions like these will require numbers of experiments commensurate with the complexity of the systems being studied.Research InterestsMicrofluidicsBioengineeringMicrofluidics and MicrosystemsSystems and Synthetic BiologyColloids and Interfacial ScienceBiotechnologyPolymers and Soft MatterTeaching InterestsBiotechnologyQuantitative biologySystems biologyMicrofluidicsDevices and instrumentationSelected PublicationsCira, N.J., Pearce, M.T., Quake, S.R., Neutral and selective dynamics in a synthetic microbial community.
