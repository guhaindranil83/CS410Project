His research areas of interest lie in the rheology of dispersions, the flow of dispersions in pipelines and other process equipment, understanding the stability and demulsification of oil and water emulsions, studying column flotation, and measuring the flow of multi-phase fluids. The research area of stability and demulsification of crude oil emulsions is significant, as a large portion of the worlds crude oil is produced in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion. Professor Pal is working on novel methods for breaking the water-in-oil emulsions and is also continuing his research work on the separation of emulsified oil droplets from oily waste waters using a flotation column. In addition to his research work, Professor Pal wrote a book and more than 100 refereed journal publications pertaining to his research areas of specialization. From 1992 to 2004, he served as Associate Editor of the Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering. In recognition of Professor Pals distinguished contributions in chemical engineering before the age of 40, he received the Syncrude Canada Innovation Award in 1998 from the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering. He also received the 2001 Teaching Excellence Award from the UWaterloo Faculty of Engineering, as well as the Outstanding Performance Award from UWaterloo in 2009.Research InterestsRheology of dispersionsflow of dispersions in pipelines and other processstabilitydemulsification of oil/water emulsionscolumn flotationflow measurement of multi-phase fluidsSeparation ProcessesInterfacial PhenomenaColloids & Porous MediaNon-equilibrium ThermodynamicsTransport PhenomenaDrag Reduction in Turbulent FlowsEducation1987, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo1981, Bachelor's, BTech, Indian Institute of Technology, KanpurCourses*CHE 230 - Physical Chemistry 1Taught in 2015CHE 610 - Theory and Application of Transport PhenomenaTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 200 - Equilibrium Stage OperationsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019CHE 211 - Fluid MechanicsTaught in 2017CHE 330 - Chemical Engineering ThermodynamicsTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 313 - Applications of Heat and Mass TransferTaught in 2018* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsPal, Rajinder, Second Law Analysis of Adiabatic and Non-Adiabatic Pipeline Flows of Unstable and Surfactant-Stabilized Emulsions, Entropy, 18(4), 2016Pal, Rajinder, Modeling the Viscosity of Concentrated Nanoemulsions and Nanosuspensions, Fluids, 1(2), 2016Pal, Rajinder, Influence of Droplet Size on Exergy Destruction in Flow of Concentrated Non-Newtonian Emulsions, Energies, 9(4), 2016Pal, Rajinder, Comment on Effective thermal conductivity of metal and non-metal particulate composites with interfacial thermal resistance at high volume fraction of nano to macro-sized spheres[J.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
