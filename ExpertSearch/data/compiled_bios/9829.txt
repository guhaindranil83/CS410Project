The technology could be used in robots for manufacturing assembly lines. WATCH VIDEO Pushy robots learn the fundamentals of object manipulation Using a novel dataset that captures how pushed objects move, Associate Professor Alberto Rodriguez is training robots to learn pushing dynamics that are fundamental to many complex object-manipulation tasks. READ MORE Giving robots a faster grasp Associate Professor Alberto Rodriguez has found a way to significantly speed up the planning process required for a robot to adjust its grasp on an object by pushing that object against a stationary surface.
