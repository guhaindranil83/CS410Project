Miller Professor of Law Emerita BA, Mount Holyoke College JD cum laude, Boston University Areas of Interest Health Law Contact Office Room 1720C Email fmiller@bu.edu Phone 617-353-4469 Full CV Biography Professor Frances Millers zest for knowledge has turned her into one of the foremost experts on American health care law and policy and a specialist on comparative health systems. She served as a consultant to the White House Task Force on Health Care Reform in 1993 and was awarded two Fulbright Scholarships to research the effects of competition on British health systems, as well as a Kellogg Foundation National Fellowship to study the delivery of health care in Europe, Africa, South America, the Middle East and China. At Boston University, Professor Miller, the 1989 recipient of the Universitys Metcalf Cup and Prize for teaching excellence, teaches courses in health law, antitrust in the health sector, food and drug law as well as trusts and estates. As far as Im concerned, health care is the most interesting and challenging area of the law, she says. With continually changing regulation, insurance coverage and medical service delivery innovations, health lawyers have to know how the health sector functions, but they also must be smart, well-rounded attorneys who understand basic legal doctrine relating to such areas as labor law, contracts, antitrust, intellectual property, malpractice law and bioethics. Professor Miller is additionally known for her expertise in trusts and estates, and she made two PBS television series on the topic in the 1980s. The author of many articles in legal and medical journals, and an editor of several books, Professor Millers recent volume Rights and Resources in the International Library of Medicine, Ethics and Law series, was published in 2003. She is faculty editor of the American Journal of Law and Medicine and a trustee of the Joslin Diabetes Center and of Mount Holyoke College.
