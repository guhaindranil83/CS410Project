He has previously worked at several academic institutions including the College of Engineering in Madras, India; the University of Toronto, the University of Ottawa and the Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands. In the past, Professor Ponnambalam has been a Research Assistant Professor and the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies in the Systems Design Engineering department at UWaterloo. His research interests include design optimization under uncertainty, mainly pertaining to issues in civil, chemical, electrical and environmental engineering. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the many applications, much of the work has been done in collaboration with colleagues from both within and outside the university. In addition, Professor Ponnambalam is also working in the Application of Intelligent Systems to hydrology and water resources, health decision making, control of satellite communications, and fault detection analysis. He has received research funding from the Communitech Database Grant, the FEDDEV Grant, NSERC Engage Grant, NSERC Discovery Grant, Ontario Research Fund, MITACS Doctoral Scholarship, and CITO Industrial Research Grant. As a result of his research work, Professor Ponnambalam has received numerous awards including the Distinguished Performance in Research, Teaching, and Service, Faculty of Engineering Award, from the University of Waterloo in 2006; and the Best Student Paper Award at the 2011 International Conference of Financial Engineering.Research InterestsDesign Optimization under UncertaintyStoHigh-level Design of Software StructuresSystems Theory & OptimizationSoftware EngineeringSustainable DevelopmentLarge Scale OptimizationReliability Based Design of Large SystemsSustainable Product DesignSocietal & Environmental SystemsModeling & SimulationApplication of Intelligent SystemsWaterEducation1987, Doctorate, Civil Engineering (Systems Analysis and Design), University of Toronto1981, Master's, Engineering Hydrology, University College, Galway - The National University of Ireland1979, Bachelor's, Civil Engineering, Madras UniversityCourses*SYDE 770 - Selected Topics in Communication and Information SystemsTaught in 2016SYDE 202 - SeminarTaught in 2017, 2019SYDE 621 - Mathematics of ComputationTaught in 2015, 2018, 2019SYDE 760 - Topics in Engineering DesignTaught in 2018, 2019SYDE 531 - Design Optimization Under Probabilistic UncertaintyTaught in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019SYDE 262 - Engineering Economics of DesignTaught in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMahootchi, M and Ponnambalam, K and Tizhoosh, HR, Response to the comments by Joodavi, A., and Mozafari, M. on Operations optimization of multireservoir systems using storage moments equations by M.
