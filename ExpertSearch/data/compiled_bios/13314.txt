His research has focused on both theoretical and applied problems in statistical signal and image processing. His early work on failure detection in dynamic systems is still widely cited and used in practice, and his more recent research on multiresolution methods for large-scale data fusion and assimilation has found application in fields including target tracking, object recognition, fusion of nontraditional data sources, oil exploration, oceanographic remote sensing, and groundwater hydrology. His book, Signals and Systems, co-authored with Professor Alan Oppenheim has been widely used throughout the world for more than 25 years.
