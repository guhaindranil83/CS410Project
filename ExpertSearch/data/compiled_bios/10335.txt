He specializes in: 1) Bone quality and fragility - developing improved understanding of the mechanisms that determine the mechanical behaviour and failure of bone and how collagen modifications due to ageing, disease, irradiation, and other causes alter these mechanisms and the mechanical behaviour of the tissue. 2) Engineering of bone mimetic materials for skeletal reconstruction by leveraging the exciting and rapidly advancing fields of additive manufacturing/3D Printing, biomineralization, and mechanics of multi-scale biological and biomimetic composites, researchers seek to gain improved understanding of the materials science and mechanics of these exceptional materials and to develop disruptive new technologies for application in skeletal reconstruction and repair (orthopaedics), particularly graft materials for treating large skeletal defects caused by trauma, cancer, etc.Research InterestsMechanics of Biomaterials and TissuesBoneBiomechanicsBiomaterialsBiomedical EngineeringBone Quality and FragilityAdditive ManufacturingOrthopaedics/OrthopedicsMechanical testingFracture mechanicsCollagenTissue EngineeringEducation2008, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, Dalhousie University2003, Master's, Mechanical Engineering, Queen's University2001, Bachelor's, Mechanical Engineering, Queen's UniversityCourses*BME 161 - Introduction to Biomedical DesignTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017SYDE 161 - Introduction to DesignTaught in 2015SYDE 182 - Physics 2 (Dynamics)Taught in 2017, 2018BME 182 - Physics II - DynamicsTaught in 2017, 2018SYDE 740 - Selected Topics in Human SystemsTaught in 2017, 2018BME 355 - Anatomical Systems ModellingTaught in 2019BME 402 - SeminarTaught in 2019BME 462 - Biomedical Engineering Design Workshop 3Taught in 2019SYDE 780 - Selected Topics in Engineering SciencesTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsBahmani, Aram and Comeau, Patricia A and Montesano, John and Willett, Thomas L, Extrudable hydroxyapatite/plant oil-based biopolymer nanocomposites for biomedical applications: Mechanical testing and modeling, Materials & Design, 2019Comeau, Patricia and Willett, Thomas, Printability of Methacrylated Gelatin upon Inclusion of a Chloride Salt and Hydroxyapatite Nano-Particles, Macromolecular Materials and Engineering, 2019Willett, Thomas L and Dapaah, Daniel Y and Uppuganti, Sasidhar and Granke, Mathilde and Nyman, Jeffry S, Bone collagen network integrity and transverse fracture toughness of human cortical bone, Bone, 120, 2019, 187 - 193Bahmani, Aram and Li, Geng and Willett, Thomas L and Montesano, John, Generating realistic representative microstructure of biomimetic composite materials for computational assessment of mechanical properties, Materials Today: Proceedings, 7, 2019, 373 - 381Dapaah, Daniel and Bahmani, Aram and Montesano, John and Willett, Thomas L, A Continuum Damage Mechanics Model Of The Microdamage Process Zone During Cortical Bone Fracture, Materials Today: Proceedings, 7, 2019, 402 - 409Attia, Tarik and Grynpas, Marc and Willett, Thomas L, Ribose pre-treatment can protect the fatigue life of -irradiation sterilized bone, Cell Tissue Banking, 1 - 9Willett, Thomas and Josey, David and Lu, Rick Xing Ze and Minhas, Gagan and Montesano, John, The micro-damage process zone during transverse cortical bone fracture: No ears at crack growth initiation, Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials, 74, 2017, 371 - 382Woodside, Mitchell and Willett, Thomas L, Elastic--plastic fracture toughness and rising JR-curve behavior of cortical bone is partially protected from irradiation--sterilization-induced degradation by ribose protectant, Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials, 64, 2016, 53 - 64 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
