We focus on 1) epigenetic regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene transcription, 2) response of tumor suppressors to genomic damage, 3) evolutionary conservation of cis-acting regulators of alternate mRNA splicing, and 4) clinically identified gene sequence variants of unknown significance as they affect alternate splicing patterns and cancer risk.
