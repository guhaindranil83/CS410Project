EHSAN MADADI Dr. Ehsan Madadi joined the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at California State University, Long Beach as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2020. He received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Iowa State University in 2017, with a focus on quadrature-based models for multiphase and turbulent reacting flows. Before joining CSULB, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow (2017-2020) at the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering (2020), and the Center for Water and the Environment (2017-2020) at the University of Texas at Austin, where he contributed to several nationally funded projects in collaboration with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and United States Department of Energy. His research focuses on the development, implementation, and validation of accurate and tractable computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools for multiphase and turbulent flows, and environmental fluid modeling. He has generated new computational algorithms that improve our ability to model complex physical processes of fluid flow and transport for computational modeling of multiphase, turbulent mixing, and reacting flows.
