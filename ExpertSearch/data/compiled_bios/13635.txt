He holds a BASc, MASc, and PhD from the University of Ottawa, in Ottawa, Canada. Dr. Lacroix is primarily interested in studying the behaviour of mid- and high-rise wood structures subjected to extreme loading (e.g. earthquake, blast, impact). Dr. Lacroixs expertise is in the structural and dynamic performance of wood systems under blast and impact loading, strengthening and retrofitting of wood structural elements using fibre reinforced polymers (FRP), and modelling of wood members under high strain rates. His research interests also include the structural performance of lateral load resisting systems in mass timber buildings, modern and innovative timber connections, resilient design of structures, and evaluation of timber members and engineered wood products at low and high strain rates.Research InterestsTimber designEarthquake engineeringWood structures under extreme loadsStrengthening and retrofitting of wood structural elements using fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP)Traditional and modern timber connectionsHigh strain rate effects on wood propertiesHazard mitigationResilient structuresDynamic behaviour of timber and timber-hybrid structures to impact and blast loadingMaterial performance and evaluationEducation2017, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Ottawa2013, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Ottawa2011, Bachelor of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of OttawaCourses*CIVE 497 - Special Topics in Civil EngineeringTaught in 2019CIVE 700 - Topics in Structural EngineeringTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsLacroix, D.N. and Doudak, G, Effects of High Strain Rates on the Response of Glulam Beams and Columns, Journal of Structural Engineering, 144(5), 2018Lacroix, Daniel N. and Doudak, Ghasan, Determining the Dynamic Increase Factor for Glued-Laminated Timber Beams, Journal of Structural Engineering, 2018Lacroix, D.N. and Doudak, G, Experimental and Analytical Investigation of FRP Retrofitted Glued-Laminated Beams Subjected to Simulated Blast Loading, Journal of Structural Engineering, 144(7), 2018Poulin, Mathieu and Viau, Christian and Lacroix, Daniel N and Doudak, Ghasan, Experimental and Analytical Investigation of Cross-Laminated Timber Panels Subjected to Out-of-Plane Blast Loads, Journal of Structural Engineering, 144(2), 2017Lacroix, DN and Viau, C and Ct, D and Poulin, M and Lopez, AV and Doudak, G, Overview on the structural performance of timber structures under the effects of blast loading--research and design considerations, Structures and Architecture: Beyond their Limits, 2016Viau, Christian and Lacroix, Daniel N and Doudak, Ghasan, Damage level assessment of response limits in light-frame wood stud walls subjected to blast loading, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 44(2), 2016, 106 - 116Lacroix, D.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
