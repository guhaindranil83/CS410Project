Page Professor of Biology; Member, Whitehead Institute; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute David C. Page examines the genetic differences between males and females and how these play out in disease, development, and evolution. 617-258-5203 Phone WI-461F Office dcpage@wi.mit.edu Email Lab Website Susan Tocio Assistant 617-258-5070 Assistant Phone Education MD, 1984, Harvard Medical School BS, 1978, Chemistry, Swarthmore College Research Summary We seek to understand the genetic differences between males and females both within and beyond the reproductive tract. We study the medical ramifications of these differences in a broad context, through comparative biological, evolutionary, developmental and clinically focused analyses. Our three main veins of research relate to sex differences in health and disease, sex chromosome genomics, and germ cell origins and development.
