He holds a BSc in mathematics and a BSc in physics (both summa cum laude) since 1988 from University of Ottawa. He spent two years of his undergraduate studies at Caltech. In 1993, he obtained a PhD in theoretical particle physics from McGill University. Since graduation, Dr. Nguyen has worked at Defence Research Development Canada (DRDC). His interests lie in unmanned systems, combinatorial optimization, stochastic processes and discrete mathematics. Dr. Nguyen has worked in many environments including NORAD and former US Space Command in Colorado Springs (USA), NATO Centre for Maritime Research & Experimentation in La Spezia (Italy) and Defence Research and Development Canada Atlantic in Dartmouth (Nova Scotia). He has received a number of awards including a Gold Medal from University of Ottawa for the best student of the Faculty of Science, a Deputy Minister Commendation (Department of National Defence) for his work on NORAD beacons, a National Practice Prize from the Canadian Operational Research Society for developing and modelling the concept of operations for autonomous underwater vehicles. Professor Nguyen received approximately 1.1 million dollars from DRDC and other agencies to investigate collaborative operations of multiple autonomous agents.
