Wilson and D.G. Fisher). Research Description:Because I am retired, my current research activities are rather limited and I no longer supervise graduate students. My research is concerned with the development of improved techniques for process control, process monitoring, and system identification. The research involves a balance of theoretical analysis, process simulation, and experimental applications.
