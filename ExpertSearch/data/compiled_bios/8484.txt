Research projects funded by the Price Center must be related to its mission of advancing both the theory and practice of entrepreneurship. The project proposal must demonstrate how the research, and/or subsequent research, will meet this standard. We invite cutting-edge research that advances the understanding of entrepreneurship at a level that has potential to significantly enhance the performance of entrepreneurial practice and/or policy. Submissions must be original research papers that have not yet been published, or accepted for publication. Papers should focus on research topics such as managing entrepreneurial growth, the start-up of new ventures, or organizational scale-up. Applicants are asked to develop a brief proposal with narratives that pertain to objectives and methodology to be submitted along with a budget and any information on outside funding sources. Preference is for projects with a presentation forum and a completion date clearly in mind. We typically award 5-8 grants of up to $10,000 during each award cycle. Detailed information and applications are sent out via the Anderson listserv. Questions can be directed to: Jennifer Hoang McMillen, jhoang@anderson.ucla.edu Oral History Research UCLA Anderson initiated Entrepreneurs of the West to create a series of oral history interviews with entrepreneurs who have played a significant leadership role in the growth and development of California and the West, and to supplement the existing historical record of their accomplishments. Participating entrepreneurs meet with a carefully supervised and trained MBA student for a recorded interview to discuss preselected topics and questions. Interviewers complete a thorough background study of the entrepreneur and his or her accomplishments to conduct as many as 10 two-hour sessions to produce the history, which, following approval by the entrepreneur, is preserved and available for use by qualified researchers. The project aims to create a positive and unique learning experience for the student interviewer, an enhanced historical perspective of business and individual entrepreneurial success, and a permanent record of the initiative and risks involved in helping to build the economy of California and the West. Entrepreneurs of the West benefits from the rich resources of the UCLA Oral History Program, one of the nations oldest and most distinguished university programs in that field. The program is sponsored by the Price Center, UCLA Anderson, the UCLA Oral History Program, and the Price Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies. Oral Histories Completed John E.
