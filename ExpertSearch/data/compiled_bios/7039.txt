Materials Science and Engineering, University of California Berkeley, 1983Ph.D. Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1991Research Scientist, NASA Glenn Research Center, 1991-2010 "I joined the faculty of UVA Engineering for the opportunities to interact with students in the classroom and lab, to collaborate with faculty in MSE, MAE and SEAS, and to participate in the Rolls-Royce University Technology Center on Advanced Material Systems." Elizabeth J. Opila, Professor Our research focuses on materials for use in extreme environments and can be applied to materials for use in aircraft engines, rocket engines, energy conversion technologies, and thermal protection systems. We first create critical aspects of the use environment in the lab such as high temperatures (up to 2000C), reactive gases (oxygen, water vapor), and high flow rates ( hundreds of meters per second). We characterize materials before and after exposure using techniques as simple as weight change to sophisticated state-of-the-art microscopies and spectroscopies. Experiments are linked with theory and computational techniques where possible. We ask these questions about material behavior: What reactions occur and why? How fast do they occur? Can we predict material lifetimes? How can we make better materials? Awards Mercatur Fellow, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Research Training Group, Materials Compounds from Composite Materials for Applications in Extreme Conditions 2020 Fellow of the American Ceramic Society 2014 Fellow of the Electrochemical Society 2013 Research Interests Corrosion and Electrochemical Sciences and Engineering High Temperature Materials Science and Oxides Advanced materials for transportation applications In the News From Conserving Art To Making Jet Engines More Durable From Conserving Art To Making Jet Engines More Durable When studying art conservation as an undergraduate, Rebekah Webster eventually realized she was more interested in the chemistry that led to changes such as degraded colors in paintings. In graduate school, she shifted her focus to a different kind of corrosion what happens inside jet engines. Shes gaining a better understanding of corrosion processes in professor Elizabeth Opilas lab in the University of Virginias Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Read More U.Va. Engineering Professor Puts New Materials To Extreme Tests U.Va. Engineering Professor Puts New Materials To Extreme Tests Pass Elizabeth Opilas laboratory in the evening, and you can see her equipment glow. Thats because Opila, an associate professor ofmaterials science and engineeringat the University of Virginia, is interested in the response of materials to hot and reactive conditions. And when Opila says hot, she means it. She and her students are heating materials to as high as 2,000 degrees Celsius.
