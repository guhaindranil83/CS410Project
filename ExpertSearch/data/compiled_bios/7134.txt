He received the B.A.Sc. and Ph.D degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, in 1982 and 1986, respectively. Since 1986, he has been with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology. He is an internationally recognized leader in wireless physical communications and wireless systems with numerous refereed publications in these areas. Dr. Stber spent the summers of 1993 and 1996 with Nortel Networks in Richardson, TX and Ottawa, Canada, respectively, and part of the summer of 2000 as a Visiting Professor at Johannes Kelper University in Linz, Austria. Dr. Stber is an active industry consultant.
