He is a critical human geographer who uses innovative combinations of computational analysis, participatory engagement, and traditional qualitative methodologies to questions about the cultural and epistemological limits of information and communication technologies (ICTs). A majority this work has examined what impacts the use of digital technologies has on Indigenous knowledge systems, with a primary interest in how digital forms of knowledge politics open space for new forms of interepistemological dialogue or extend colonial knowledge hierarchies. This interdisciplinary work draws on a wide body of work, including digital geographies, Indigenous studies, postcolonial theory, ICT for development, science and technology studies (STS), and more. Much of this work has occurred in the Peruvian Amazon and the Canadian Arctic. More recent research has expanded these research interests. Projects under development include studies of the role of public libraries in development across sub-Saharan Africa; the impact of community-owned digital networks on rural, Indigenous communities in Alaska and Peru; and the role of informal education in combatting misinformation in rural communities. Jason received his PhD from the UW Department of Geography in 2017.
