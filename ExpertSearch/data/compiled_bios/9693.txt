I mainly focus on research incomputational intelligence(neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary computation, kernel machines, and swarm intelligence). My research team developed various hybrid intelligent systems based on multiple intelligent techniques for different applications. The primary new intelligent techniques include genetic fuzzy neural networks, granular neural networks, granular support vector machines, granular kernel machines, granular decision trees, granular decision fusion, granular feature selection, computational web intelligence, distributed data mining, and parallel intelligent systems. Data mining:We designed new methods for imbalanced data classification, feature selection, multiple classification, noise analysis, data fusion, and decision fusion. Bioinformatics:We implemented useful algorithms for biomarker selection, cancer diagnosis using microarray data, protein structure prediction, protein structure assessment, protein methylation prediction, and biomedical data classification. Web intelligence:We developed several computational web intelligence systems for e-business, web mining, semantic web, search engines with long query, computing with granular words, NBA scouting, and web-based stock value prediction. Intelligent parallel/distributed computing:We completed several intelligent parallel/distributed systems, including granular parallel granular neural networks, kernel trees with parallel genetic algorithms, distributed computing applications such as pervasive distributed dynamic sensor data mining system, distributed fuzzy mobile agents for e-commerce, and distributed medical data on grids.
