The various NetBeans IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) sponsored and released by Oracle Coproration and/or its affiliates. The various Sakai platforms (CLE and OAE) sponsored and released by The Sakai Foundation, to support a worldwide community of educators collaborating to create open software that advances teaching, learning and research. Elite Education Initiatives The following higher learning initiatives, in support of the University of Macaus (UM) institutional context for elite undergraduate education, are currently being investigated by Dr. Kam Hou Vat with the collaboration from the Center for Teaching and Learning Enhancement (CTLE) at UM: Sakai OAE (Open Academic Environment) is a new system that embraces a new vision for academic collaboration. Watch the demonstration of the Sakai OAE from New York University The Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA) initiative, supported by the Council for Aid to Education (CAE), offers an authentic approach to the improvement of teaching and learning in higher education through a continuous improvement model, and recognizes faculty as central actors in educational improvement efforts. The CLA assists faculty, department chairs, school administrators and others interested in programmatic change to improve teaching and learning, particularly with respect to strengthening higher order skills (metacognition). The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) is dedicated to improving the scholarly and public quality of research. It operates through a partnership among the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia, the Simon Fraser University Library, the School of Education at Stanford University, and the Canadian Centre for Studies in Publishing at Simon Fraser University.
