He joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Northeastern University in 1989. Between 1984 and 1989 he held faculty and research positions at Tel Aviv University, the Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems at M.I.T., Brown University and the University of Texas, Dallas. He has also held visiting positions at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base and at the Technion (Israel), and has consulted in areas related to electric motors and drives, electro-optics, CAD, aeroengine control and fluid flow modeling and control. His research has been supported by NSF, ARO, AFOSR, the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory and SatCon Technologies Co.Important: Professor Tadmor is currently on leave and is unable to accept any new graduate and post-doctoral advisees.
