Admission to the mechanical engineering graduate programs normally requires a bachelors degree in engineering (not necessarily in mechanical engineering), a GPA of at least 3.0/4.0 on all graduate and undergraduate work, Graduate Record Examination scores of at least 310 (Verbal + Quantitative and at least 160 on the quantitative section) and 3.5 (Analytical), and Test of English as a Second Language scores of 550 (paper-based) / 213 (computer-based) / 80 (Internet-based). An undergraduate degree in chemistry or physics combined with a strong interest in engineering topics may be acceptable when certain required undergraduate courses are also taken. Satisfying the above requirements does not guarantee admission to the mechanical engineering graduate program. The masters degree requires 24 credit hours of course work and a thesis (Plan A). A non-thesis option (Plan B) consisting of 30 credit hours is available with admission and enrollment limited to those students with acceptable previous research or design experience. Enrollment in the non-thesis option requires the approval of the director of graduate studies and must be requested within the students first ninecredit hours of graduate course work.
