Dr. Boylands focus has been on enabling programmers to make their software more efficient by finding complex programming errors. He has been the faculty advisor for six student groups, and he was the recipient of a prestigious National Science Foundation Career grant. Dr. Boyland is on sabbatical for the 2020-21 academic year.
