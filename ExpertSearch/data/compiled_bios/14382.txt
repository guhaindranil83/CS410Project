I hold a Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Kings College London, University of London, U.K. My research are focused on neural networks, medical devices, bespoke robotic solutions for industries and laboratories in medical, life science, energy and agri-food areas. I have been working on projects from EU, EPSRC and Innovate UK on DNA extraction robotics, biomass sample handing robotics and Li-ion battery measurement and modelling most recently. I have published over 30 research articles in peer-reviewed journals such as: IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics and IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering. I am member of IEEE IET and IMeChE.
