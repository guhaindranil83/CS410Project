He has been involved in research projects across Canada, as well as in the Caribbean, South America, Egypt, Oman, Iran, Italy, and the United States. Dr. Coniglio served as Associate Vice-President, Academic from 2013 to 2019. Contact informationOffice: ESC 311Phone: 519-888-4567, ext. 32066Email: coniglio@uwaterloo.ca Expertise Geological processes of sedimentation and diagensis (the chemical and physical changes that occur as sediments solidify) Carbonate deposits in the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian sequences of Southern Ontario Research Dr. Coniglio's research focuses on sedimentation and diagenesis of carbonate rocks in the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian sequences of southern Ontario. Interests include physical and chemical aspects of shallow and deep burial diagenesis and porosity development in dolomitized hydrocarbon reservoirs and groundwater aquifers. Please note that he is currently not accepting graduate students nor providing opportunities for supervision of internships.
