Cabrales Arevalo Professor, Bioengineering Gas transport physiology and bioengineering design for development of next generation blood substitutes; Bioengineering microcirculation; The effect of blood substitutes on oxygen transport to tissue. My research work is on the transport of biological gases and their ability to regulate or affect cellular metabolism. My aim is to design novel therapeutic interventions to treat, manage and ultimately prevent disease using an integrative analysis of physical and chemical phenomena, based on engineering sciences principles and methods. Currently, my research relates to in vivo understanding how oxygen and other gases (e.g. nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon monoxide) are made available to the tissues, their biological function, and how their levels are regulated. Attention is given to conditions such as inflammation, hemorrhagic shock, polycythemia, anemia and red blood cell pathologies such as malaria and sickle cell disease.
