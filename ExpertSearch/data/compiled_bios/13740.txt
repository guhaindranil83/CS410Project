Johns Hopkins University, 1999Ph.D. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2005Post-Doc Harvard Medical School, 2005-2008 "My research combines engineering principles with molecular biology to tackle fundamental problems in cancer and infectious disease." Kevin Janes, Professor Kevin Janes designs and uses new experimental and computational approaches for analyzing cell signaling and transcriptional networks in cancer and infectious disease. He received his B.S. and B.A. degrees in Biomedical Engineering and Spanish at Johns Hopkins University in 1999. He was a Fulbright Scholar at La Universidad de Santiago de Compostela in Spain before attaining his Ph.D. in Bioengineering at M.I.T. in 2005 under the joint supervision of Douglas Lauffenburger and Michael Yaffe. Dr. Janes completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School in the Department of Cell Biology with Joan Brugge and began his faculty position at the University of Virginia in 2008. During that time, Dr. Janes was recognized as a Pew Scholar, a Packard Fellow, a Kavli Fellow, and a recipient of the NIH Directors New Innovator Award. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia, the Chair of the Tumor Biochemistry and Endocrinology study section at the American Cancer Society, and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors for Science Signaling.
