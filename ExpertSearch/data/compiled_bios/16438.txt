I am a joint Researcher betweenthe RISELab at UC Berekelyand the Division of Network and Systems Engineering at KTH Royal Insitute of Technology. My research focuses on optimization theory and machine learning, with applications in networking. You can visit my old personal homepagehere, which may include some moreacademic and professional records. The easiest way to reach me is by email: hshokri@kth.se Recent News Apr. 2018:we have received The 2018 IEEE Communications Society Stephen O. Rice Prize forour paper Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks: A MAC Layer Perspective, IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. 63, No. 10, pp. 3437- 3458, October 2015 .This award is given to the best IEEE Transaction paper of the Communication Society in the recent years. The motivation is that "this was the first paper providing an integrated view on the Medium Access Control layer issues for millimeter wave cellular networks.
