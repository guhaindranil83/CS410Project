SU CNS SU Computational Neuroscience Research Group Home People Publications Positions SU Math Seattle University Department of Mathematics Bayesian neural coding We build models for how neural circuits can perform Bayesian inference. We test the models in the sound localization system of barn owls. Statistical analysis of neural data We build statistical models for neural responses in the sound localization system of barn owls to determine how neurons respond to sounds and their location. Modeling sound localization circuits We use anatomical, neurophysiological, and behavioral data to create functional models of the owl's sound localization pathway.
