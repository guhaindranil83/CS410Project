His teaching and research interests lie in the area of systems and control theory with application to flight control systems. His current interests focus on a geometric approach for impulsive control systems and nonlinear control methods for unmanned air vehicles. Past research projects, sponsored by NASA and the U.S. Air Force, include the development of integrated guidance and control technology for reusable launch vehicles and reduced-order modeling for active flow control systems. Research Interests: systems and control theory, flight control systems All Degrees Earned: Ph.D., Electrical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 1991; M.S., Electrical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, 1988; B.S., Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, 1983 Journal Article, Academic Journal (19)Brajot, F., Lawrence, D.
