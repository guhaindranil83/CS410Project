This is UJ's first-time entry in this prestigious edition. UJ has been ranked in the 301-400 rank band globally, thus in the Top 400 for Arts and Humanities and joint fourth in South Africa along with University of KwaZulu-Natal and University of the Western Cape. The 1 000 universities that form part of the rankings represent 5% of the 20 000 or so higher education institutions in the world. These universities were selected for analysis, based on the strength of their record in international research and on their global academic reputation. The performance metrics used cover the full range of a university's core activities: teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. Universities have all been evaluated by their academic peers through THE's annual Academic Reputation Survey, which draws on more than 20 000 survey responses from senior scholars from more than 140 countries. Universities are under pressure to show their relevance and impact in society. The Faculty has incorporated this call to action into its 2020 strategy. Research projects within the Faculty aim to demonstrate how the Faculty is being innovative and what the impact of being innovative is on our environment and the community we serve.
