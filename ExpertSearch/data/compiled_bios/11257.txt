He has served as Department Chair at both Binghamton and Portland, and was the founding Director of Binghamtons Institute for Research in Electronics Packaging. Jim has also held faculty positions at the University of Saskatchewan, Victoria University of Wellington (NZ), and South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, with visiting/sabbatical positions at Loughborough University (UK), Chemnitz University of Technology (Germany), University of Maryland (USA), University of Bordeaux (France), University of Greenwich (London), Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden), Dresden University of Technology, University of Canterbury (NZ), and Helsinki University of Technology, with honorary appointments at Shanghai University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Other positions have included Senior Technician and Post-Doctoral Fellow at the U of S, brief periods with Delphi Engineering (NZ) and IBM-Endicott (New York), and industrial consulting. Dr. Morris was awarded the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa by the Politehnica University of Bucharest, Romania, in 2015. Jim is an IEEE Life Fellow and a Distinguished Lecturer for the IEEE Electronics Packaging Society (EPS, previously CPMT.) He has served as CPMT Treasurer (1991-1997), Vice-President for Conferences (1998-2003), on the CPMT Board of Governors (1996-1998, 2011-2016) and currently on the joint Oregon CAS/EPS Chapter executive committee. He was awarded the IEEE Millennium Medal and won the CPMT David Feldman Outstanding Contribution Award in 2005. He was an Associate-Editor of the IEEE CPMT Transactions for 20 years and has been General Chair of three CPMT-sponsored conferences, Treasurer or Technical Chair of others, and has otherwise served on multiple CPMT conference committees. As the CPMT Society representative on the IEEE Nanotechnology Council (NTC,) he instituted a regular series of Nanopackaging articles in the IEEE Nanotechnology Magazine, established the NTC Nanopackaging Technical Committee, (which also acts as a program committee for annual IEEE NANO conferences,) served as the 2010-2012 NTC Awards Chair, chaired the IEEE NANO 2011 and NMDC 2018 conferences in Portland and the virtual NANO 2020, served as NTC Vice-President for Conferences (2013-2014) and VP for Finances (2015-2018, President-Elect ((2019) and is currently President (2020-2021). He also co-founded the Oregon Chapter of the IEEE Education Society in 2005 and sits on its executive committee, and was Program Chair for the 1st and 2nd IEEE Conferences on Technology for Sustainability (2013/14). He is also a member of the International Microelectronics & Packaging Society (IMAPS) andthe American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) and is a Fulbright alumnus Dr. Morris has 55 years of teaching experience in six countries since his first appointment as a laboratory teaching assistant at 19 years old. His research activities are focused on electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs), the electrical conduction mechanisms in discontinuous nanoparticle thin metal films, with applications to nanopackaging and single-electron transistor nanoelectronics, and on an NSF-funded project in undergraduate nanotechnology education. He has edited or co-authored six books on electronics packaging and two on nanodevices, and lectures internationally on nanopackaging and electrically conductive adhesives. He has published 25 book chapters, 61 journal papers, and 106 peer reviewed and 61 other conference papers and presentations, and holds one patent. These publications cover work in both Esaki and resonant tunnel diodes, switched mode power supplies, automotive and other applied electronics, microprocessor systems, sensors, discontinuous metal thin films, electronic materials, and education.
