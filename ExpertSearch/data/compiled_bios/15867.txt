He is currently leading a national project on costs of edaphic stresses to the Australian grains industry. He is also leading the northern grains region in national GRDC projects to identify and manage soil constraints, conservation agriculture, strategic tillage and sustainable land management practices. While his research spans in the areas of crop production, much of his research focuses on soil constraints. He has also coordinated soil carbon and soil quality projects in Queensland cropping soils. Yash has great faith in engagement with the farmers to develop collaborative, participatory research project to address soil health issues. He also has strong interest in proximal and remote sensing to identify constraints at farm and national scales for site-specific soil and nutrient management.
