She conducts field and laboratory studies and complements these with numerical modelling techniques. Her current research focuses on passive groundwater remediation technologies, the release and transport of metals at northern mine sites, the fate of wastewater contaminants in shallow sand aquifers, and the fate of emerging contaminants in the environment.
