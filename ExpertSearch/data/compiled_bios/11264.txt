He is currently the Director of the Biomedical Signal Processing Lab in the ECE Department. He is also an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Biomedical Engineering Department, Oregon Health & Science University. Dr. Wan has led a diverse number of research projects over the years ranging from autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles, speech enhancement for cellular communications, to noninvasive glucose monitoring. Dr. Wan is best known for his pioneering work on the Unscented and Sigma-Point Kalman filters for probabilistic inference. Dr. Wan holds several patents in adaptive signal processing and integrated navigation and has authored over 85 technical papers in the field. He is co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of MotioSens Inc., a tech-transfer startup developing smart technologies to monitor the activity, mobility, and wellbeing of seniors living independently.
