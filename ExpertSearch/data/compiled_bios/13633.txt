He was Chair of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering from 2008 to 2016. Dr. Thomson has over 30 years of research experience in the use of field investigations, laboratory experiments, and numerical models to explore subsurface contaminant fate and remediation issues. Current research topics include emerging soil and groundwater remediation technologies, petroleum hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chemical oxidants, functional nanoparticles, electrokinetics, high resolution monitoring, isotopes and biomarkers, delivery methods, site characterization, and physical model and comprehensive pilot-scale studies. Dr. Thomson is currently the Editor-in-Chief of Groundwater Monitoring & Remediation, a National Ground Water Association publication. In 2018, 2014 and 2005 he received an Outstanding Performance Award from the University of Waterloo for outstanding performance in teaching and scholarship. In 2008 he was awarded the Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award for his outstanding contribution in teaching, scholarship and service. In 1999 he was awarded the Sir Sanford Fleming Teaching Excellence Award for recognition of an exemplary record of outstanding teaching, concern for students and a commitment to the development and enrichment of engineering education at Waterloo. He provides expert technical assistance on topics that include conceptual site model development; groundwater flow and fate analysis; and remedial alternative selection, design, and monitoring.Research InterestsHydrogeologyGroundwater and Soil ContaminationBrownfieldsContaminant Fate and TransportNon-Aqueous Phase LiquidsRemediation EngineeringModellingLaboratory ExperimentsPilot-Scale InvestigationsEducation1986, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo1982, Master's, MASc, University of Toronto1981, Bachelor's, BASc, University of WaterlooCourses*CIVE 499 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2016ENVE 499 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2016CIVE 400 - Civil Engineering Design Project 1Taught in 2015GEOE 499 - SeminarTaught in 2016CIVE 770 - Topics in Environmental EngineeringTaught in 2017ENVE 400 - Environmental Engineering Design Project 1Taught in 2017GEOE 400 - Geological Engineering Design Project 1Taught in 2017CIVE 776 - Soil & Groundwater RemediationTaught in 2015, 2018ENVE 573 - Contaminant TransportTaught in 2018, 2019ENVE 401 - Environmental Engineering Design Project 2Taught in 2019GEOE 401 - Geological Engineering Design Project 2Taught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsCho, M.S., F.
