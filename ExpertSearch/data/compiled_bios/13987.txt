SURAJIT ROY Dr. Surajit Roy joined the CSULB Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department as an Assistant Professor in Spring 2017. He obtained his Ph.D. from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University in 2014. In his Ph.D. research, he focused on studying the influence of variation in ambient temperature, and operating loads on structural damage detection using piezoelectric transducers. As a postdoctoral research associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), he was involved with development of prognostic algorithms based on Bayesian framework for the remaining useful life estimation of structural components. He also was involved with numerical modeling and simulation of ultrasonic wave propagation in structures, and fluid-structure interaction for non-invasive flow characterization of gases in pipes under extreme low pressures. His current research interests are development of prognostic models for material ageing under harsh environments, reduced-order modeling for structural wave propagation, non-destructive testing techniques, and data-driven algorithms for structural health monitoring.
