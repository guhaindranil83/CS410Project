She started her independent career atCase Western Reserve University School of Medicine(2010-2017), where she was promoted through the ranks of Assistant,Associate, and Full Professor. Steinmetztrained atThe Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA where she was an NIH K99/R00 awardeeand AHA post-doctoral fellow (2007-2010); she obtained her PhD inBionanotechnologyfrom the University of East Anglia where she preparedher dissertation as a Marie Curie Early Stage Training Fellowat theJohn Innes Centre, Norwich, UK (2004-2007). Steinmetzis a Fellow of the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE, since 2017); she has won many awards, including anAmerican Cancer Society (ACS) Research Scholar Award (2016), and a Young Innovator of Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering Award from the Biomedical Engineering Society (2015). Steinmetzs teaching philosophy was shaped during her time as a high level athlete competing for the German National Team in Artistic Roller Figure Skating; her goal is to teach students to be fearless when approaching experimental challenges, learning difficult techniques, or presenting their results in front of their peers, and to always stand up and try again until they succeed.
