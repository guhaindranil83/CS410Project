Prior to this, he worked for 4 years at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. From 1997-2002 he was an assistant professor at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in Dayton, Ohio and from 2002-2007 he was an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. He has been part of the Aerospace Engineering faculty at OSU since 2007. Expertise Research interests include: Heat transfer in gas turbines including internal cooling, film cooling, and impingement cooling. Fouling of gas turbines and implications for aero/thermodynamics of jet engines and power turbines Flow control applications in low pressure turbines including blowing, suction, and passive control Flow control applications to static and dynamic airfoils Dynamic stall of rotorcraft blades with applications of flow control Effects of surface roughness on aerodynamics and heat transfer Students who are interested in working with Dr. Bons should have completed coursework in the following areas: Fluid mechanics (viscous flow, compressible flow, etc) Heat transfer (convection, conduction, radiation) Thermodynamics Air-breathing propulsion Having coursework in this area is not required, but it is desirable.
