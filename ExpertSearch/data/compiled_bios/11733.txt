Manfredi Professor of Mathematics, Undergraduate Director, PhD Manfredi works on elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations of p-Laplacian type, including the case p equals infinity, in Euclidean spaces and in subRiemannian manifolds. These equations are used to model phenomena where the relevant energy is non-quadratic. He is interested in regularity and other fine properties of p-harmonic functions.
