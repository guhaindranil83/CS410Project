He graduated magna cum laude with Honors in 1993 with an ScB degree in mathematics and physics. He did his graduate study in mathematics at Harvard University, receiving an AM in 1995 and a PhD in 1998. He had postdoctoral positions at the University of Rochester (from 1998 to 2000) and the University of Toronto (from 2000 to 2001). From 2001 to 2004, he was an assistant professor at Bucknell University. Dr. Lansky has been a member of the American University Department of Mathematics and Statistics since 2004. His research interests lie in the representation theory of p-adic groups and automorphic forms. His current research centers on distinguished representations and liftings for p-adic and finite groups.

RESEARCH INTERESTS Dr. Lansky's research interests lie in the representation theory ofp-adic groups and automorphic forms. Past work has involved algebraic modular forms on various groups and their corresponding Galois representations, Artin L-functions and the Dedekind Conjecture, representations of parahoric Hecke algebras, and newforms for certain groups. He is currently studying liftings of representations of certain finite and p-adic groups, orthogonally distinguished supercuspidal representations of GL(n) with applications to the Shimura correspondence, and quantum mechanical entanglement.
