Bement Jr. Award Kaushik Roy, the Edward G. Tiedemann Jr. Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering, will receive the 2020 Arden L. Bement Jr. Award for significant accomplishments in pure and applied science and engineering. Kaushik Roy, the Edward G. Tiedemann Jr. Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering, will receive the 2020 Arden L. Bement Jr. Award for significant accomplishments in pure and applied science and engineering. Roys work exploits nanoscale electronic devices to achieve functionality analogous to biological neurons and synapses with the potential for improvements in the energy efficiency and compactness of computing hardware. He is being honored for pioneering and field-defining research across neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing devices, circuits and algorithms. The Arden L. Bement Jr. Award was established in 2015 by Distinguished Professor Emeritus Arden Bement and his wife, Mrs. Louise Bement. The award is the most prestigious given by the university in pure and applied science and engineering. This is the third straight year the award has gone to a member of the ECE faculty. Evgenii Narimanov received the award in 2019, and Peide Ye received it in 2018.
