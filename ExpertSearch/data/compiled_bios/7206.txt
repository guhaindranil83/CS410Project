He received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Peking University in 2009, and the M.S. degree and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 2011 and 2013, respectively. From 2013 to 2018, he was an assistant professor at Arizona State University. Prof. Yus research interests are nanoelectronic devices and circuits for energy-efficient computing systems. His expertise is on the emerging non-volatile memories (e.g., RRAM, ferroelectrics) for different applications such as deep learning accelerator, neuromorphic computing, monolithic 3D integration, and hardware security. Among Prof. Yus honors include the NSF Faculty Early CAREER Award in 2016, the IEEE Electron Devices Society (EDS) Early Career Award in 2017, the ACM Special Interests Group on Design Automation (SIGDA) Outstanding New Faculty Award in 2018, the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) Young Faculty Award in 2019, and the ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC) Under-40 Innovators Award in 2020. Prof. Yu is active in professional services. He served or is serving with many premier conferences on technical program committees, including the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM), IEEE Symposium on VLSI Technology, ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC), ACM/IEEE Design, Automation & Test in Europe (DATE), and ACM/IEEE International Conference on Computer-Aided-Design (ICCAD). He is a senior member of the IEEE.
