Annable is an Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Waterloo. He is affiliated with Professional Engineers of Ontario, the Association of Professional Geoscientist of Ontario, the American Geophysical Union, the Geological Society of America, and the International Association of Hydrogeologists. He has been researching the hydraulic, sediment transport and morphological characteristics of rivers for over the past 18 years. In addition, he has been designing, monitoring and supervising the construction of natural channel restoration projects throughout North America - totalling over 2,500km of streams and rivers studied and over 180km of restored river channels. Professor Annables recent research has focused on the sediment transport characteristics of urban river systems and how changes in hydrology affect habitat dynamics. He is specifically interested in river restoration, rehabilitation and aquatic habitat improvements. The study of basin scale isotope hydrology and sediment transport of non-point source contaminants, along with conducting numerical and field studies of groundwater surface water interaction and karst hydrology are other interests of his as well. Additionally, Professor Annable conducts field and numerical modelling studies on urban river mechanics, hydraulics and hydrology. His current sources of research funding are from NSERC, CFI, EPA, Water Districts, Municipalities, and DFO.Research InterestsRiver Hydraulics and Sediment TransportRiver RestorationFlood ManagementEcohydraulicsKarst HydrologyEnvironmental monitoringEducation2010, Doctorate, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Colorado State University2003, Doctorate, Earth Sciences, University of Waterloo1995, Master's, School of Engineering, University of Guelph1993, Master's, Earth Sciences, University of Waterloo1990, Bachelor's, Environmental Studies, University of Waterloo1987, Bachelor's, Physics, University of WaterlooCourses*ENVE 299 - SeminarTaught in 2015GEOE 299 - SeminarTaught in 2015ENVE 398 - SeminarTaught in 2016GEOE 398 - SeminarTaught in 2016CIVE 770 - Topics in Environmental EngineeringTaught in 2015, 2017ENVE 330 - Lab Analysis and Field Sampling TechniquesTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CIVE 381 - HydraulicsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2018CIVE 280 - Fluid MechanicsTaught in 2018ENVE 383 - Advanced Hydrology and HydraulicsTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMcKie CW, C Juez, BD Plumb, WK Annable, MJ Franca, How large immobile sediments in gravel bed rivers impact sediment transport and bed morphology, Submitted to Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 2021, 147(2): 04020096, DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001842.
