Chemical Physics University of Reading, UK, 1974Ph.D. Physics, University of Reading, UK, 1979 "My research has created materials that increase fuel efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions, and saved lives by providing better ballistic impact protection." Haydn N. Wadley, University Professor Dr. Wadley has very broad interests in materials science, mechanics and thermal transport. His current research explores high temperature thermal protection systems (thermal barrier coatings, liquid metal heat plates for hypersonic vehicle leading edges, jet blast deflectors) and new materials for the mitigation of high intensity dynamic loads (ballistic and blast protection materials and structures). Research Interests Microscale Heat Transfer Nanoelectronics and 2-D Materials Corrosion and Electrochemical Sciences and Engineering Intelligent Processing of Materials Metallurgy High Temperature Materials Science and Oxides Computation Materials Science Nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing Advanced materials for transportation applications Selected Publications "Defect Controlled Transverse Compressive Strength of Polyethylene Fiber Laminates", International Journal of Solids and Structures, 52, p. 130-149. 2013 M.R.
