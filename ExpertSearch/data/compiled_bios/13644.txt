Costas research lies at the interface between science, engineering and architectural design with an emphasis on energy in buildings and communities. His research is focused on questions of energy efficiency, solar energy generation and energy transaction in the built environment. These research efforts aim towards the evolution of (i) building envelope technologies, (ii) climate-resilient cities and communities and (iii) energy integration between the building and transportation sectors. Costa serves as an associated editor of the Architectural Engineering journal and co-leader of the IEA PVPS Task 15 Subtask C on the development of Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) technical guidelines.Research InterestsSolar energyClimate-resilient buildings and communitiesBuilding integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) and other advanced envelope technologiesElectrification and decarbonization of the building sectorDistributed energy resources (DER)Demand response (DR)Occupancy behaviourCo-simulations Daylighting Smart grid Education2016, Doctorate, Building Engineering, Concordia University2009, Master of Applied Science, Building Engineering, Concordia University2005, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Physics, University of AthensSelected/Recent PublicationsKapsis, Konstantinos and Athienitis, Andreas and Harrison, Stephen, Determination of Solar Heat Gain Coefficients for Semitransparent Photovoltaic Windows: An Experimental Study., ASHRAE Transactions, 123, 2017Kapsis, Konstantinos and Athienitis, Andreas K, A study of the potential benefits of semi-transparent photovoltaics in commercial buildings, Solar Energy, 115, 2015, 120 - 132Temby, Owen and Kapsis, Konstantinos and Berton, Harris and Rosenbloom, Daniel and Gibson, Geoffrey and Athienitis, Andreas and Meadowcroft, James, Building-integrated photovoltaics: distributed energy development for urban sustainability, Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, 56(6), 2014, 4 - 17O'Brien, William and Kapsis, Konstantinos and Athienitis, Andreas K, Manually-operated window shade patterns in office buildings: A critical review, Building and Environment, 60, 2013, 319 - 338 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
