She is also the James and Marsha McCormick Director of the Nancy E. and Peter C. Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering. Professor van der Meulen received her B.S. from MIT and M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford University. Before joining the faculty at Cornell, she worked for three years as a biomedical engineer at the Rehabilitation R&D Center of the Department of Veteran Affairs, in Palo Alto, California. In 1995, she received an NIH FIRST Award and in 1999 an NSF Faculty Early Career Development Award. She is member ofthe American and European Societies of Biomechanicsand the Orthopaedic Research Society. She is a fellow of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Professor van der Meulen is also vice presidentof the Orthopaedic Research Society, Deputy Editor for the Journal of Orthopaedic Research, member of the NIH Skeletal Biology, Structure and Regeneration study section, and steering committee member for the IBMS Sun Valley Workshop on Musculoskeletal Biology.Jonathan Butcher Associate Director, Director of Undergraduate StudiesJonathan Butcher is a Professor in Biomedical Engineering at Cornell University. He received his joint BS/MS degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the University of Virginia, and his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology. Prior to joining the faculty at Cornell in 2006, he held a post doctoral appointment in Developmental Biology/Pediatric Cardiology, at the Medical University of South Carolina. He is the recipient of the John Swanson '61 ME Excellence in Teaching Award (Cornell University, College of Engineering), an NSF CAREER Award (National Science Foundation (NSF)), the Hartwell Foundation Individual Biomedical Research Award - Cornell Nominee (Hartwell Foundation), Rita Schaffer Young Investigator Award (Biomedical Engineering Society) and the Lillihei Prize - Young Investigator Award (Society for Heart Valve Disease). His research program focuses on understanding the roles of mechanical forces in shaping cardiovascular morphogenesis and adult disease with an emphasis on heart valves.Jan Lammerding Director of Graduate StudiesJan Lammerding is an Associate Professor in the Nancy E. and Peter C. Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering and the Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology at Cornell University. After obtaining a Diploma Ingenieur degree in Mechanical Engineering in his native Germany, he completed his Ph.D. in Biological Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying subcellular biomechanics and mechanotransduction signaling in the laboratories of Roger Kamm (MIT) and Richard T. Lee (Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital). Before joining Cornell University, Dr. Lammerding served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital while also teaching in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. Dr. Lammerding has won several prestigious awards, including a National Science Foundation CAREER Award, an American Heart Association Scientist Development Grant, and the BWH Department of Medicine Young Investigator Award. Dr. Lammerding was featured as one of the 2014 Young Innovators in the Cell and Molecular Bioengineering Journal. Dr. Lammerding has published over 50 peer-reviewed articles, including in Nature, Science, and PNAS. His research is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program.Newton de Faria Professor of Practice,Director of Master's of Engineering ProgramDr. de Faria earned his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 1998. He brings nearly two decades of experience working in industry and has held numerous teaching appointments. For the last decade, he has focused on medical devices, analytical devices and pharmaceutical application markets in the biomedical and health industries. He has worked as the Senior District Sales Manager and Strategic Accounts Manager for National Instruments Corporation. He has taught BME 6500, Biomedical Instrumentation, at the University of Connecticut. Dr. de Faria brings a passion for accelerating productivity, innovation, and discovery in the biomedical industry. He will prepare Master of Engineering students for a wide range of careers by incorporating BME industry-oriented training using a design-centric approach. Our graduates will be prepared to address engineering challenges in the regulatory environment associated with modern healthcare. We will benefit greatly from his breadth of experience and commitment to education. We are delighted to have Dr. de Faria serve in this vitally important role and anticipate great success under his leadership.
