After post-doctoral appointments at Vanderbilt University and University of Oklahoma, where he worked on asymptotic geometry and boundary dynamics of discrete groups, he moved in 2011 to a post-doctoral appointment at KodLab, the legged locomotion laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, to start work on applications of topology and category theory to problems of knowledge representation in the context of navigation and control. In fall 2019 he has joined NCR as a research scientist to work on developing formal and category-theoretical methods in hybrid control, as part of the AFOSR Center of Excellence in Assured Autonomy in Contested Environments.
