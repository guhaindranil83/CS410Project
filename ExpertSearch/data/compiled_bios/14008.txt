DANIEL WHISLER Dr. Daniel Whisler graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a Ph.D. in Structural Engineering in 2014. After serving as a postdoctoral fellow doing research in impacts and composites, he joined California State University, Long Beach in Fall 2015 as an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. His research focuses on developing experimental and computational techniques for extreme loading environments and understanding dynamic behavior of materials and structures. Experimental and finite element validation tests include composites, foams and honeycombs, and sandwich panels ranging from coupon-sized to full-scale actual components. This research is being applied in vehicle crashworthiness, projectile impacts onto structures, explosive blast mitigation and protection from natural disaster.
