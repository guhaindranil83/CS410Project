It specialized in mergers and acquisitions and equity financings for private and public companies, and became known for its focus on the intersection of media and technology. Montgomery & Co. merged its operations into Signal Hill in 2013. Prior to Montgomery & Co., Montgomery served as president and CEO of Sega GameWorks LLC, a joint venture between Sega, Universal Studios and DreamWorks.
