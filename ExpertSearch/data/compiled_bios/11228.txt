I am especially interested in interdisciplinary questions which use tools from these fields in unexpected ways. More specifically, current/recent projects are concerned with relationship between quantum dynamics and graph theory, and, adjacently, developing develop quantum and hypergraph theoretic tools to study the social networks arising from online black markets. I am also interested in the roles of diversity and inclusivity mathematics. This informs my teaching style, which incorporates student perspectives and experiences in a meaningful way. I do this not only to motivate the importance of the course-specific content, but to highlight the importance of diversity and inclusivity in the mathematical community as a whole.
