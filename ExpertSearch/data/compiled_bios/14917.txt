Sparling Professor Emeritus phil.sparling@gatech.edu Educational Experience: Doctorate and masters (exercise physiology), University of Georgia; bachelor of science (psychology) cum laude, Duke University Research Interests: exercise physiology, physical activity & diet, behavioral medicine Overview: My first 20 years were devoted to investigating the effects of different types of exercise training on physical performance, body composition, and cardiorespiratory health. Since the mid-1990s, I've focused on understanding physical activity and eating patterns as modifiable health behaviors. Publications includesome 70 peer-reviewed articles and three textbooks includingiHealth: An Interactive Framework, now in its 4thedition (McGraw-Hill, 2020). In addition to being a professor at Georgia Tech for three decades, I was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Cape Town Medical School (South Africa), a Senior Scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(Atlanta), and a Visiting Research Professor in the School of Population Health at the University of Queensland (Australia). I'm an elected Fellow of theAmerican College of Sports Medicine, National Academy of Kinesiology, Society of Behavioral Medicine,andResearch Consortium ofSHAPE America.
