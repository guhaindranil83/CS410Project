He is also the Director of the Advanced Micro & Nanodevice Lab at the university and holds the Canada Research Chair in Micro and Nanodevices. Professor Yeows research expertise lies in Micro-/Nano- Electro Mechanical systems. He aims to develop mechanical machines that are integrated with microelectronics at the micron scale. New device concepts include, but are not limited to: the integration of micro-optics components, miniature signal processing devices, biomedical/genome processing devices, miniature electromechanical wireless components (filters, mixers, antennas), miniature opto-electromechanical devices (optical cross connect, optical relays, optical multiplexers, deformable optics), miniature biosensors and environmental sensors, and microfluidics devices. Professor Yeow also explores issues such as self-testing, self-assembly, and automated packaging. He is currently developing nanodevices and highly selective sensors that will help create new medical instruments for diagnosing and treating disease. These include MEMS optical scanner for endoscopic optical coherence tomographic imaging, micromirror devices for genetic microarray reading and tissue imaging, robotics for micromanipulations of MEMS components, carbon nanotube-based sensors for biomedical applications, and lab-on-a-chip designs. Additionally, Professor Yeows company ARTsensing Inc. has commercialized an invention which is a product of his research the worlds first transparent and flexible radiation detector that measures ionizing radiation delivered to cancer patients during treatment. In addition to his many accomplishments, Professor Yeow was the recipient of the Young Engineer Award from the Ontario Society of Professional Engineers in 2008.Research InterestsMEMS/NEMSOptomechatronic SystemsBiomedical SensorsLab-on-a-chipBioMEMSMicroassemblyMicroelectromechanical SystemsRobot Mechantronic DesignMicrosystemAdvanced ManufacturingNanotechnologyBiomedicalGas SensorsRadiation SensorsRadiation ShieldsX-rayUltrasoundOptical DevicesEducation2003, Doctorate, PhD, University of Toronto1999, Master's, MASc, University of Toronto1997, Bachelor's, BASc, University of TorontoCourses*SYDE 182 - Physics 2 (Dynamics)Taught in 2015SYDE 682 - Advanced MicroElectroMechanical Systems: Principles, Design & FabricationTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019SYDE 252 - Linear Systems and SignalsTaught in 2016BME 386 - The Physics of Medical ImagingTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019NANO 702 - Nanotechnology ToolsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsYeow, John TW, Effective and Efficient [The Editor's Desk], IEEE Nanotechnology Magazine, 10(2), 2016, 4 - 4Li, Zhenhao and Chen, Siyuan and Nambiar, Shruti and Sun, Yonghai and Zhang, Mingyu and Zheng, Wanping and Yeow, John TW, PMMA/MWCNT nanocomposite for proton radiation shielding applications, Nanotechnology, 27(23), 2016Lu, Limin and Chen, Chen and Samarasekera, Champika and Yeow, John TW, Influence of zeolite shape and particle size on their capacity to adsorb uremic toxin as powders and as fillers in membranes, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials, 2016Luo, Hua and Sun, Weijie and Yeow, John TW, Modelling and adaptive dynamic sliding mode control of dielectrophoresis-based micromanipulation, Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, 2016Wong, Lawrence LP and Na, Shuai and Chen, Albert I and Li, Zhenhao and Macecek, Mirek and Yeow, John TW, A feasibility study of piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers fabrication using a multi-user MEMS process, Sensors and Actuators A: Physical, 247, 2016, 430 - 439 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
