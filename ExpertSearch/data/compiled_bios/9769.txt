Daziano received a Ph.D. in economics from Laval University in 2010. He joined the CEE faculty in January 2011 adding a new dimension to the area of sustainable systems engineering in both teaching and research.Research InterestsDaziano's research focuses on engineering decision making, specifically on theoretical and applied econometrics of consumer behavior and discrete choice models applied to technological innovation in transportation and energy. Daziano's specific empirical research interests include the analysis of air travel demand, the study of pro-environmental preferences toward low-emission vehicles, modeling the adoption of sustainable travel behavior, estimating willingness-to-pay for renewable energy, and forecasting consumers' response to environmentally-friendly energy sources.Statistics and Machine LearningTransportationComplex Systems, Network Science and ComputationTransportation Systems EngineeringTeaching InterestsDaziano teaches graduate courses in Microeconometrics of Discrete Choice and Transportation Energy Systems, and an undergraduate course in Engineering Economics and Management. Topics covered in his classes include economic models of decision making for engineering, analysis of choice microdata, statistical point and interval estimation, simulation-aided inference (Monte Carlo techniques), Bayesian econometrics, nonlinear optimization, and advanced numerical methods. He also teaches a Freshman Engineer Advising Seminar.Service InterestsUndergraduate Academic Advising (CEE and ORIE), Undergraduate Research Advising, Graduate Admissions, Reviewer for several Academic Journals, Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Proposal Reviewer, Fonds de recherche du Qubec - Nature et technologies FRQNT (Group Research Grants in Industrial Engineering) Proposal Reviewer.Selected PublicationsChiew, E., R A.
