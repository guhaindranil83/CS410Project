Boyer Professor of Biology Laurie A. Boyer investigates the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive heart development and regeneration using embryonic stem cells and mouse models. 617-324-3335 Phone 68-230 Office lboyer@mit.edu Email Lab Website Adjovi Koene Assistant 617-324-4026 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2001, University of Massachusetts Medical School BS, 1990, Biomedical Science, Framingham State University Research Summary We investigate how complex circuits of genes are regulated to produce robust developmental outcomes particularly during heart development.A main focus is to determine how DNA is packaged into chromatin, and how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers modify this packaging to control lineage commitment. We are now applying these principles to develop methods to stimulate repair of damaged cardiac tissue (e.g., regeneration). Our ability to combine genomic, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches both in vitro and in vivo as well as ongoing efforts to use tissue engineering to model the 3D architecture of the heart will ultimately allow us to gain a systems level and quantitative understanding of the regulatory circuits that promote normal heart development and how faulty regulation can lead to disease.
