Jan Unknownto Present Associate Provost Interdisciplinary Programs Dr. Reifsnider was charged with creating and staffing this office in 1996. The duties of this position included budget and reporting responsibility for 18 University Centers and related interdisciplinary degree programs with an annual budget responsibility of over $2 million. Activities included working with the directors of existing centers and institutes to promote interdisciplinary research and graduate education; providing oversight and establishing a reporting relationship with University center and institute directors; initiating and providing support for interdisciplinary funding proposals; identifying new program areas where interdisciplinary activities would seem fruitful; assisting faculty to organize interdisciplinary teams; generally encouraging and supporting interdisciplinary research and graduate education across the campus; and helping to identify program and funding opportunities for interdisciplinary activities. Dr. Reifsnider established the first Office of Interdisciplinary Programs at Virginia Tech, and established University guidelines for indirect cost revenue distributions. During his term, interdisciplinary research at Virginia Tech grew at an unprecedented rate, from about 9% of total research expenditures to about 20% of that total on a yearly basis. Jan Unknownto Present Chairman Materials Engineering Science Program Dr. Reifsnider chaired a university-wide interdisciplinary doctoral program from 1974 to 1992. The program grew by a factor of ten during that period, and typically had over sixty doctoral candidates enrolled, and graduated about 8 PhDs per year. (In 1974 before he took over the program, it was targeted for termination because of under subscription). Seven academic departments in three colleges, and two university-wide centers participated in the program. Jan Unknownto Present Deputy Director \Science and Technology Center Dr. Reifsnider served as Deputy Director of the NSF Science and Technology Center for High Performance Polymeric Adhesives and Composites, which had contract funding for over $20 million for the eleven years of operation. He was one of the primary authors of that proposal, the first successful proposal of that type in the State of Virginia. Jan Unknownto Present Director Virginia Institute for Material Systems As Director of this Commonwealth Center for the State of Virginia, Dr. Reifsnider reported to the office of the Provost at Virginia Tech. Activities under his direction included a research program that involved 15 faculty members, 23 graduate students, 2 postdoctoral fellows, and 1 technician; a development program which established 2 new laboratories and purchased 26 items of research equipment, established funding for complementary research with 12 industries, and provided the base for proposals which brought in over $16 million to the university in 1988 90; and an educational program that brought 2 new faculty members into the university, and provided support for a tutorial and a short course. Total expenditures of the Institute over the five years of his service were about $2.2 million. Jan Unknownto Present Founder Materials Response Group Dr. Reifsnider founded the Materials Response Group at Virginia Tech. In 2002, that group consisted of five faculty members and over twenty graduate students, and several postdoctoral fellows. Expenditures for that group were typically more than $800,000 per year. That research group was one of the primary groups on which the Center for Composite Materials and Structures was built, and made a substantial contribution to the development of the materials discipline on that campus and in the State of Virginia. The Composites in Virginia initiative was based in that group. Dr. Reifsnider typically ranked within the top 5-10 researchers at Virginia Tech in total dollars of research funding. Jan Unknownto Present Founder and Leader Composites in Virginia Initiative Dr. Reifsnider was the founder and creator of the statewide initiative, Composites in Virginia. That initiative sponsored three conferences by that name, one anchored by a keynote address by then-Gov. Baliles. Over 400 industries in the State were associated in some way with that initiative. A liaison group with the state legislature was established. The initiative played a role in the establishment of the Virginia Commonwealth Center for Material Systems by the State Council on Higher Education in Virginia, and was strongly supported by the Virginia Department of Economic Development and the Virginia Center for Innovative Technology. Jan Unknownto Present Founding Editor Journal of Composites Technology and Research Dr. Reifsnider co-founded the Journal of Composites Technology and Research for the American Society for Testing and Materials, and served in various editorial and co-editorial posts from 1979-1988. He has also chaired several committees of ASTM, and served as a member of that Board of Directors in 1984-88. Jan Unknownto Present Pratt & Whitney Chair of Design and Reliability Dr. Reifsnider was the second of six one million dollar chairs hired by the University of Connecticut as part of their initiative to create the Connecticut Global Fuel Cell Center at UCONN. As such, the Center represented the largest single investment of a university and State in a concentrated fuel cell science and engineering facility, and features a new building dedicated to the activities of the Center. Dr. Reifsnider developed a laboratory for the study of durability and long-term performance of solid oxide and polymer-based fuel cells at that facility, which featured the first comprehensive membrane characterization facility for fuel cells in the U.S. The laboratory also conducts substantive research for industrial partners including United Technologies Fuel Cells (UTCFC), and United Technologies Research Center. The first condition-based reliability lab for fuel cells was created by Reifsniders group in 2006 with funding from UTCFC and the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund. A second major research thrust of the laboratory was the development of composite materials for high temperature fuel cells.
