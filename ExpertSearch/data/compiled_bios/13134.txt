However, when it comes to the internet as a whole and connecting the mass of people to their respective destinations, an efficient algorithm is more difficult to produce. One direction that researchers have gone to pursue this is to study the behaviour of ants for their techniques to find the shortest path between two points. In this paper, the Ant Colony Optimization Technique has been applied in different network models with different number of routers and structures to find the shortest path with optimum throughput. The performance measure taken here is the shortest path as well as time taken by the data packets from source to destination.
