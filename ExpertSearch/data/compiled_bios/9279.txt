Binzel Professor of Planetary Sciences and Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow Chair, Undergraduate Committee | Secondary Appointment - AeroAstro Richard Binzelis oneof the worlds leading scientists in the study of asteroids and Pluto. As the inventor of the Torino Scale, a method for categorizing the impact hazard associated with near-Earth objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets, his ongoing telescopic research includes the spectral characterization of asteroids posing a potential hazard to Earth as well as those that may be most easily reachable by future robotic and human missions. His scientific analysis has shown the link between major meteorite groups and their formation and source locations. Asteroid number 2873 bears his name, an honor bestowed by the International Astronomical Union in recognition of his contributions to the field. His mapping efforts of Pluto in the 1980s revealed a diverse surface entreating for exploration, finally achieved in 2015 as a co-investigator on NASAs New Horizons mission. He is also a co-investigator on NASAs OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission where he leads the development of a student-built flight instrument, the Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrograph (REXIS). Binzel was awarded the H. C. Urey Prize by the American Astronomical Society in 1991. He also was awarded a MIT MacVicar Faculty Fellowship for teaching excellence in 1994 and is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has been a faculty member in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT since 1999. Wikipedia Publications G. Randall Gladstone, S.
