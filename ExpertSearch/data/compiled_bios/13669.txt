He specializes in buried pipeline soil structure interaction, buried municipal water and waste water pipeline condition assessment, repair, renovation and construction using trenchless technologies. Professor Knight is the developer of the System Dynamics Financially Sustainable Buried Infrastructure Asset Management tool, BoreAid, PPI- BoreAid, PPI-PACE and CIPP CALC. PPI-PACE is an online tool developed for and released by the Plastics Pipe Institute (PPI). The purpose of this tool is to assist industry professionals in the evaluation and selection of Polyethylene (PE) pipe for pressurized water distribution and transmission main systems by completing design calculations. Professor Knight holds a patent for the Centrifugal Permeametor. This invention provides a sample chamber for a centrifugal permearmeter in order to test permeant conductivity of a porous sample. He is also the contributor and editor in Trenchless Technology: Planning Equipment and Methods (published 2013) on the chapter Horizontal Directional Drilling and Project Planning.Research InterestsTrenchless technologiesBuried Infrastructure Asset ManagementHorizontal Directional DrillingGeotechnical EngineeringCentrifuge Modelling and TestingUnsaturated Flow in SoilsContaminate TransportPavement Design and Field InstrumentationWaterEducation1996, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, Queen's University1992, Master's, Civil Engineering, University of New Brunswick1984, Bachelor's, Geological Engineering, University of New BrunswickCourses*CIVE 353 - Geotechnical Engineering 1Taught in 2015, 2017CIVE 750 - Topics in Geotechnical EngineeringTaught in 2015, 2018, 2019CIVE 401 - Civil Engineering Design Project 2Taught in 2017CIVE 752 - Trenchless TechnologiesTaught in 2018CIVE 554 - Geotechnical Engineering 3Taught in 2017, 2018, 2019CIVE 354 - Geotechnical Engineering 2Taught in 2019GEOE 354 - Geotechnical Engineering 2Taught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsRehan, Rashid; Unger, Andre; Knight, Mark A.; Haas, Carl, Strategic Water Utility Management and Financial Planning Using a New System Dynamics Tool, Journal American Water Works Association, 107(1), 2015, E22 - E26LinkRehan, R., Knight, M.A. Haas, C.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
