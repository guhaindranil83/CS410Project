She earned a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, where she worked on topology optimizationforimproved manufacturability and cellular material design. Carstensens research focuses on the new opportunities arising as digitalization of design and manufacturing is transforming the way we create the built environment. Her group develops and evaluates new design methods and tools that use structural mechanics and mathematical optimization to advance the design of structures on length scales ranging from material architectures, over component to large scale structural design. She is a dedicated mentor and teacher, and is actively involved in the Structural Engineering and Design MEng program.
