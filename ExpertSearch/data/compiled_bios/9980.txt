Dr. Chengs general interests lie at the intersection of computer science and discrete mathematics, especially in algorithm design, combinatorial optimization, combinatorics, and graph theory. A main research focus is stable matchings, a solution concept used to match medical residents to hospital programs, students to schools, or kidneys to kidney patients.
