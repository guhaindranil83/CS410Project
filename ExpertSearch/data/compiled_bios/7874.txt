Every aspect of every course should be a learning opportunity.Transmitting factual information and analytical methodology is straightforward, but broader skills are often de-emphasized in conventional courses. I use assignments such as laboratory exercises, student-led discussions, group projects, and case studies to supplement conventional assessment tools such as examinations and homework assignments.
