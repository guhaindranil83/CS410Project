Education Ph.D. in Management Science & Engineering, Stanford University, 2013 M.S. in Technology and Policy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2008 B.S. in Electrical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin, 2006 Research Statement Dr. Lius research interests focus on the design and evaluation of healthcare interventions to improve patients health and enable cost-effective care delivery. She develops methods in sequential decision making, decision analytics, and systems modeling to optimize healthcare systems. Her work advances mathematical modelling methods to support complex technology adoption and policy decisions surrounding the prevention and management of diseases. She has received multiple grants from the National Science Foundation to design an integrated decision framework for depression monitoring, and optimize vaccination incentives to prevent infectious disease outbreaks. Dr. Liu has collaborated with the UW Medicine and Global Health, the Stanford Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research, the Veteran Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, and the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. She is a member of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Science (INFORMS), the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM), Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE), and the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society.
