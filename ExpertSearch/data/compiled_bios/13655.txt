He is a licenced Professional Engineer in Ontario and Nova Scotia and is also a Principal at Blackwell Structural Engineers. Dr. Zurell has extensive experience in building design as well as bridge design, and has been involved in many architectural- and engineering-award-winning projects. While experienced with a variety of structural materials, he is particularly experienced in timber design, and has lectured at various industry events on adaptive reuse of historic buildings and the use of heavy/mass timber in large, non-residential buildings. Prior to joining UW full-time, Dr. Zurell was an adjunct instructor for over ten years, teaching structural design courses to architecture and engineering students at UW as well as at Laurentian Universitys School of Architecture. Dr. Zurell is a member of the Technical Committee for CSA S6, the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, for which he chairs the Timber Design Sub-committee. Dr. Zurell does not have an active research program and does not accept graduate students.Research InterestsStructural EngineeringStructural Design of BuildingsStructural Timber DesignAdaptive Reuse of Historic Building StructuresReinforced Concrete DesignStructural Steel DesignHeritage StructuresTimber Bridge DesignEducation2004, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Ottawa1997, Bachelor of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of WaterlooCourses*ARCH 362 - Steel and Concrete: Design, Structure and ConstructionTaught in 2015ARCH 662 - Steel & Concrete: Design, Structure and ConstructionTaught in 2015ARCH 277 - Timber: Design, Structure and Construction for EngineersTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CIVE 415 - Structural System DesignTaught in 2016CIVE 700 - Topics in Structural EngineeringTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsGraeme J.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
