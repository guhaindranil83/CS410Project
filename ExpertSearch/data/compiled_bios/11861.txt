Irrigation system design begins with a landscape plan specifying plants suitable for the available topography, soil, climate, and water. Plant species adaptable to local climate and soil conditions are easier to irrigate and maintain. The following items are necessary to consider when designing, operating, or maintaining an irrigation system for landscapes: Plant water requirements (peak demand) Condition of the water and its supply Soil type(s), condition, and topography Weather and climate information Microclimate concerns Irrigation scheduling constraints MaintenanceDaily, C., Farrell-Poe, K.

K., Hansen, C. L., & Poe, S. E. (1995). Carbon monoxide production from land applied cheese whey. Bioresource Technology, 54(3), 231-233.More infoAbstract: Cheese whey was applied at a rate of 20 l/m2 (4 lbs/ft2) to growing alfalfa (Fortress variety) on silt loam calcareous soil. Selected sites were covered with a collection tent to collect gases generated. Large amounts of carbon monoxide and relatively small amounts of methane were emitted from the soil. These results indicate a concern for whey disposal on agricultural ground and the resultant production of CO. -from AuthorsGaultney, L. D., Strickland, R., & Poe, S. E. (1985). IMPLEMENTING COMPUTER-AIDED INSTRUCTION IN AN AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING CURRICULUM.. ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings, 1, 32-39.More infoAbstract: Computer-aided instruction (CAI) can be an effective and progressive educational tool if implemented into a well developed course designed around sound learning objectives. However, incorporation of CAI into a curriculum must be carefully considered to assure that the primary goal is to assist in education and not simply to get students to use computers. Of particular interest to academicians and administrators alike is the ability of CAI to improve delivery of instruction without a corresponding increase in manpower. The paper discusses present uses of CAI in Agricultural Engineering Department at Purdue University.Strickland, R., Poe, S. E., & Gaultney, L. D. (1985). CURRICULUM FLEXIBILITY VS. INSTRUCTION SPECIALIZATION: CAI/CMI - BRIDGING THE GAP.. Paper - American Society of Agricultural Engineers.More infoAbstract: This paper covers new and emerging technologies Agricultural Mechanization will need to address in the next 20 years. It covers the need for curriculum flexibility to meet current and future needs and the use of computer driven interactive learning systems (CAI/CMI) to increase instructional efficiency and productivity.Gibson, H. G., Strickland, R. M., & Poe, S. (1982). Preliminary tests of two-stroke cycle engines fueled by ethanol/sunflower oil mixtures. SAE Technical Papers.More infoAbstract: Two stroke cycle chainsaw engines were tested comparing an ethanol/sunflower oil mixture to a conventional fuel mixture. Preliminary results indicated difficulty in starting below 50F (10C), high engine temperatures, gum deposits and possible lubrication breakdown; which indicate potential problems of using this fuel.
