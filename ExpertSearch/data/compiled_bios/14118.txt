After working 4 years in the medical (ophthalmic) device industry, Dr. Seibel designed and developed laser scanning microscopes for live tissue imaging for his doctorate from the University of Washington's Department of Bioengineering in 1996. As a Research Scientist at the Human Interface Technology Lab, UW, Dr. Seibel invented the scanning fiber endoscope which has received funding from the former Washington Technology Center (WTC), National Institutes of Health (NCI, NIBIB, NIDCR), National Science Foundation, formerly PENTAX Corporation, and finally to VerAvanti Inc., Redmond, WA. Since 2001 as research faculty at UW, Dr. Seibel has co-developed an optical projection tomography microscope with VisionGate Inc. with funding from WTC and NCI. Currently, Dr. Seibel is a Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, adjunct in Bioengineering,Electrical & Computer Engineering,and Oral Health Sciences and Director of theHuman Photonics Lab at UW. Education Ph.D. in Bioengineering, University of Washington, 1996 M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, 1984 B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Cornell University, 1983 Research Statement Multidisciplinary research program that develops novel instrumentation based on optical scanning for image acquisition and display. All research projects involve UW innovations with application in the biomedical device and instrumentation fields, with specific focus on the detection of cancer and pre-cancer and infectious diseases and their rapid treatment. Current projects Ultrathin and flexible scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) for the early cancer detection and guiding treatments within the body The goal is to advance minimally invasive medical imaging by using ultrathin flexible endoscopes that allow access to regions of the body that were previously inaccessible. Once at a region of interest, imaging, diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring can be performed from the SFE with the goal of earlier and less-invasive treatment of cancers in the more peripheral lung and pancreas. The main attributes of the SFE technology are:High-resolution full-color imaging within an ultrathin size (less than 2 mm in diameter)Wide-field multi-color fluorescence imaging with molecular sensitivity & specificityLow-cost components that may lead to a disposable distal (in vivo) endHighly flexible & durable shaft that imparts less pressure on tissuesEfficient laser scanning imaging that allows 3D imaging for future surgeriesComputer-tracked guidance system for complex branching systems like the lungSelect publications with several patents issuedSeibel, E.J. and Smithwick, Q.

DOI: 10.1136/gutjnl-2020-322945 Medical imaging processing and optical metrology Flexible bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, and endoscopy rely on the physician to observe the in vivo images in real-time for the purpose of navigating to the region of interest and guiding diagnosis and/or therapy. By using additional sensors to the microendoscope and computer vision algorithms, advancements to patient quality of care and lower risks and costs can be delivered to the patient. Examples are accurately navigating deep into the lung, fully recording the entire bladder urothelium as one digital record, and analyzing endoscopic video for guiding intervention and optical biopsy. In non-medical applications, these techniques can be used to advance 3D optical metrology of internal structures in advanced manufacturing quality control and field inspection.Select publicationsSoper, T.D., Haynor, D.R., Glenny, R.W., Seibel, E.J.

Optical monitoring of enamel health and dental diseases Tooth decay or caries is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in adults and children world-wide. The caries process involves bacteria residing in oral biofilms that produce acids that demineralize the enamel. By using visible light fluorescence spectroscopy to measure this pH within the biofilms or the relative demineralization within the enamel, new tools are being provided to the dental practitioner to manage the early stages of this disease. In later stages of caries progression, the lesions of demineralization are located at greater depth inside the teeth which can be revealed by using scanned near-infrared laser light from a SFE.Select publications Zhang, L, Nelson, LY, Berg, JH, Eichenholz, J, and Seibel, EJ.

Although cells and nuclei are three-dimensional, this standard imaging technique is only two-dimensional with only one viewing perspective. The development of the Optical Projection Tomography Microscope (OPTM) has allowed 180-degree viewing of individual cells and nuclei at submicron spatial resolution that is isometric. Three-dimensional features are more easily recognized and quantitatively measured using the OPTM, such as the volume, 3D-shape, surface area, surface texture, and 3D features of nuclear invaginations can be used as more sensitive classifiers for earlier conditions of cancer and pre-cancer. This collaborative work with VisionGate Inc. was started by funding from the Washington Technology Center (WTC) and subsequently the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

New displays are a fiber scanned microdisplay and a true 3D display that mimics the natural conditions of depth perception by adding both accommodative cues as well as stereographic cues All electronic 3D displays rely on the strong stereoscopic cue of retinal disparity using left and right-eye views. However, standard 3D displays have two display screens at a fixed focal depth, so when the eyes converge to fuse the left and right images together the eyes naturally shift focus making the image out-of-focus or the conflicting cues can cause viewer fatigue. In contrast, the UW True 3D Display allows for the full range of accommodation even for young children. The 1st generation true 3D display was fabricated and tested using a 3-year gift from the Intel Corporation. These new display prototypes are being developed under a grant from the National Science Foundation and University of Washington Technology Gap Innovation Fund.Select publicationsSchowengerdt, B.T. and Seibel, E.J., (2006) True 3D scanned voxel displays using single and multiple light sources.
