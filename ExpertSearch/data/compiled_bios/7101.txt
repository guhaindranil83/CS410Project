He was a key contributor of high-cycle low-voltage radio-frequency (RF) microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches and GaAs metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs) millimeter-wave integrated circuits (MMICs) during his tenure at UIUC. At Xindium Technologies (2000-2004), he developed a proprietary commercial-grade InP single-heterojunction bipolar transistor (SHBT) technology that led to the first demonstration of monolithically integrated 40Gb/s PIN+TIA differential-output optical receivers. Dr. Shen joined the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2005 as an Assistant Professor and was promoted a Full Professor in 2018. His research has yielded 8 awarded U.S. patents, 5 book chapters, 170+ publications in refereed journals and conferences, and many invited seminar talks to date. He is also an editor of a book entitled Nitride Semiconductor LEDs (2nd Ed., October 2017.) His current research is focused on wide bandgap semiconductor (WBG) microelectronics and optoelectronic devices with emphasis on physical device study, fabrication processing technique development, and device characterizations. Research interests: High sensitivity, III-nitride-based UV photodetectors Advanced III-nitride coherent light emitters III-nitride transistor technologies (unipolar and bipolar transistors) WBG high power electronics Compound-semiconductor Integrated circuit technologies Sustainable, green technologies **Students interested in these research areas are encouraged to contact Prof. Shen directly.
