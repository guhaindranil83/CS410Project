Professor Johnston is currently a leader in two large, multidisciplinary research groups focused on the Mackenzie and Laurentian Great Lakes. He also teaches a number of undergraduate geology courses, including the 3rd-year fieldcamp.

Great Lakes-St. Lawrence and Mackenzie watersheds (sediment, water, ice, and climate). Research Increasing pressures as a result of both human-induced and natural factors have raised concern about future available freshwater resources. Prof. Johnston's goal is to identify natural patterns and trends of sediment (coastal), water (lake level), ice (glacial isostatic adjustment) and climate (multi-decadal to millennial) to place historical events into context and help predict future scenarios. His current interests involve studying modern and ancient freshwater lakes and associated deposits to decouple climatic and human influence. He uses the latest sedimentologic, stratigraphic and geomorphic principles in conjunction with geochronological (i.e. 210Pb, 14C, OSL), gephysical (i.e. GPR), geochemical (i.e. C/N) and ecological (i.e. macrofossil, diatom) methods to link surface features to subsurface sediment clues. ProfessorJohnston is a leader in two large and long-standing, multidisciplinary research groups focused on water resources in two of Canadas most important drainage basins, the Mackenzie and Laurentian Great Lakes. The Five Ws of Dr. Johnstons Research... What? - Expertise interpreting modern and ancient coastal sediment and sequences. To unravel natural drivers of water level change (climate, sediment, outlet, glacial isostatic adjustment) during palaeohydrographic reconstruction. When? - Focus on the late Holocene, the last five millennia. Where? - The Laurentian Great Lakes (Superior, Huron, Michigan, Erie, Ontario) and Mackenzie (Athabasca, Great Slave, Great Bear) drainage basins. Well preserved deposits in remote areas. Who? - Two leading, large and long-standing, multidisciplinary research groups (and growing). Great Lakes member since 1998 and Mackenzie member since 2004. Why? Improve resolution of geological records to better merge with and extend instrumental records. Identify natural patterns and trends, place historical events in to context, and predict future possible scenarios. Teaching At the University of Waterloo, Professor Johnston teaches four classes with an enrolment of more than 630 students: 1st-year Geology & lab, 2nd-year Stratigraphy, and the 3rd-year Fieldcamp.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
