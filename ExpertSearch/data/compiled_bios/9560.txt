Faculty Profiles is an information resource at Texas State University that helps connect faculty members with each other and allows people from outside the university to find out more about faculty research, awards, scholarly/creative work, teaching, grants, and more. Faculty Profiles creates a profile by syncing with the Faculty Qualifications system to create an accurate snapshot of each faculty member's work. Faculty Profiles facultyqualifications@txstate.edu
