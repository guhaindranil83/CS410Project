Dr. Aswath has over twenty five years of experience in the area of processing of advanced materials that include monolithic and composite materials, tribology and lubrication, deformation, fatigue and fracture of specialty engineering materials and biological active materials. His work in the area of synthesis of materials involves the design of new materials using fundamental concepts in chemistry, thermodynamics and material science. Dr. Aswath has personally supervised 15 Ph.D. and 30 MS Thesis to completion. He currently has 4 Ph.D. and 4 MS Thesis students in his research group. He is currently working on a major initiative to develop a new class of environmentally friend-ly high performance lubricant additives for internal combustion engines and high load bearing lubri-cation application. In addition to the commercial success in the development of various new prod-ucts, the principle focus of the research has been in the development of a fundamental understand-ing between the chemistry of additives, tribochemistry of additive degradation and the formation of tribofilms that are responsible for protection of surfaces. The reduction of deposits on catalytic con-vertors result in reduced emission and reduced friction results in improved fuel economy. Dr. Aswath has been working with various automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Boeing Corporation and Nissan Motors, Oil and Grease additive companies such as Exxon-Mobil, Chevron-Oronite, Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Afton, Lubrizol, DuPont Chemicals, DOW Chemicals, RT Vanderbilt, and Whitmores and National Labs such as Argonne National Labs , AC2T (Wiener-Neusdtadt in Austria) and LTDS (Ecole Centrale de Lyon). A second major initiative that Dr. Aswath is currently involved in is the development of bio-compatible materials for applications ranging from structural orthopedic, tissue regeneration and drug delivery applications. These projects involve active collaboration with faculty in the Bioengineer-ing Department and have resulted in the development of 3D porous degradable polymeric scaffolds for drug delivery applications, ceramic scaffolds for smooth muscle cell culture and porous scaf-folds for tissue engineering. In addition, scaffolds for drug delivery applications have been devel-oped. In an related initiative Dr. Aswath is examining the processing and evaluation of a new genera-tion Bioglass/Polymer composite for orthopedic application. In addition he is examining new meth-ods to coat hydroxyapatite and Bioglass on Ti substrates for improved fixation with bone. More re-cently studies have focussed on the development of devices with thermoresponsive hydrogels for drug delivery applications. A fundamental study involving the mechanism of bone remodeling is the focus of some current studies. Several aspects of this project are collaborative efforts with faculty in bioengineering, mechanical engineering, UT Southwestern Medical School, Baylor college of Dentis-try, University of Trento and Scottish Rite Hospital for Children. A third major initiative is in the development of sustainable concrete for structural and trans-portation applications. This involves the use of recycled tire materials as replacement for both coarse and fine aggregates in concrete. The finished product exhibits properties equal to or better than traditional concrete with the simultaneous use of recycled materials that would otherwise find their way into landfills. An additional area of interest is in the development of concrete reinforced with bamboo for applications where steel reinforcements are unavailable. This area of research has been a collaborative effort with faculty in Civil engineering. In the past he has been involved in the development and evaluation of a new generation of ti-tanium aluminides for jet engine applications. He has worked extensively in synthesis, phase trans-formations and mechanical properties of in-situ Si3N4 reinforced barium aluminosilicate in collabora-tion with Loral Corp (Lockheed Martin Corporation). A research program evaluating the role of pro-cessing variables on the electrical and mechanical properties of Blackglas matrix composites with Nicalon and Nextel fibers was completed in collaboration with Allied Signal and Vought Aircraft Company. He has also completed NSF sponsored project to study the effects of silica additions on the creep and fracture properties of alumina based ceramics. In addition he has worked in micro-structural stability and oxidation characteristics of high temperature intermetallics. Dr. Aswath has worked closely with McDonnell Douglas Research Labs, Oak Ridge National Labs, ALCOA Research Labs, Vought Corp., Loral Vought Corp., among others.

These grants are awarded to high school teachers to further education in Materials Science and Engineering at the High School Level. Jan 2011to 2011 Mentor Upward Bound:Siemens Research Experience ProgramMentored high school merit scholars who spent summer in my lab on re-search projects. Jan 1995to 1997 Committee Member High School Outreach CommitteeDr. Aswath has been involved in the development of the structure of the out-reach program for improved recruitment of high school students for eventual admission to UTA. Dr. Aswath has designed and put together the recruitment brochure detailing the MAE program and history of mechanical engineering Other Creative Activities Other Creative Activities 3D Design Blackglas matrix composites reinforced with Nicalon and Nextel fibers were developed and characterized by Dr. Aswaths group in collaboration with Northrop Grummann Aerospace. These composites were made by polymer pyrolysis of poly siloxane precursors and process chemistry, conditions and environment were optimized to develop net shaped composites with significant high temperature properties. These composites were used in applications such as afterburners in low observable (stealth) aircraft, [Non-refereed/non-juried] Electron Microscopy Laboratory Dr. Aswath has been one of the principal people responsible for the continued devel-opment of the electron microscopy laboratory facilities for solid state materials. Dr. Aswath was the PI (together with four other faculty in engineering) who developed the infrastructure to study solid state samples by electron microscopy. Dr. Aswath was primarily responsible for the procurement and set up of all the new facilities acquired as a consequence of the NSF funded equipment grant for electron microscopy. The facility is now part of the central characterization facility that is run independently by a facilities manager. [Non-refereed/non-juried] High performance MoS2 free grease High performance MoS2 free grease which has low friction and high load bearing capacity was developed in Dr. Aswaths lab using proprietary organophosphate chemistry and long chain fluo-rocarbons. This patented technology has been commercialized by Platinum Research Organiza-tion. It finds application in various applications including CV joints, railroad applications, heavy duty applications etc. [Non-refereed/non-juried] In-Situ ceramic matrix composites based on barium aluminosilicate with b-Si3N4 reinforcements. This pro-ject done in collaboration with Loral Vought Missiles (Now Lockheed Martin) were extensively evaluated and the mechanism of synthesis of these composites were developed in Dr. Aswaths laboratory. In addition, the mechanical properties of the composites were evaluated and chemis-try and process conditions optimized based to a large extent on fundamental research in Dr. Aswaths lab. BAS-Si3N4 composites are used as radomes for missiles and rockets. [Non-refereed/non-juried] Mechanical Testing Laboratory Dr. Aswath was primarily responsible for acquiring and setting up facilities for high temperature creep and fatigue testing. This important area of research is of importance to local industries like Loral Vought, Lockheed Martin etc. In addition the availability of these facilities makes UTA a good competitor for local, state and federal grants. [Non-refereed/non-juried] Several next generation ashless and ashed anti-wear additives Several next generation ashless and ashed anti-wear additives have been developed in Dr. Aswaths lab. These additives formed the basis of several patent disclosures which have now been commercialized for applications such as engine oil and transmission oils. These additives have the potential to improve fuel economy by reducing friction and also result in reduced depos-its on catalytic convertors resulting in lower green house gas emissions. [Non-refereed/non-juried] Tribology Laboratory Dr. Aswath has put together a tribology testing laboratory from scratch by acquiring and building several tribometers. This facility has the capacity to evaluate oils and greases for their lubricating properties. This facility has made it possible to develop collaborative research projects with companies in the lubrication field such as Platinum Research Organization, Chevron-Oronite,Lubrizol Corporation, Exxon-Mobil, Vanderbilt Chemicals among others.
