My main application interest lies in problems of nutrition and physical activity, both at the molecular level and in the individual level. This has led me recently to considering problems of gene-environment interactions (where nutrition is the environment) and their effect on cancer, understanding the nature of dietary intake patterns in humans and the effect of those patterns on a host of diseases, and most recently, whether increasing physical activity increases the mean and decreases the variance of sleep efficiency.

Some of my specific research interests are listed below. Methodology: Semi-supervised inference; Semi-parametric inference with high dimensional data; Missing data and causal inference; High dimensional inference; Regularized estimation; Non-asymptotic performance guarantees. Applications: Discovery research using EMR data; Automated phenotyping; Personalized medicine (treatment selection, treatment effects estimation, risk prediction, comparative effectiveness etc.) Others: Concentration inequalities and tail bounds; Empirical processes; Debiasing and sample-splitting; Model misspecification; Non-parametric regression; Sufficient dimension reduction.

Title : Professor and Associate Department Head of OperationsPhone : (979) 845-3141Office : Blocker 459D Email : dcline@stat.tamu.eduWebsite : https://stat.tamu.edu/~dcline/My research interests fall under the general heading applied probability and stochastic processes. Put simply, I like to study the probabilistic structure and properties of processes that statisticians and others want to observe and analyze. For example, nonlinear time series models are being applied to many observed times series, using statistical methods that assume some type of stability my work looked at how one can verify such stability for specific models. More recently, I and colleagues from computer science are investigating properties of dynamic random networks with an interest in optimizing some of those properties. I am also interested in questions of real analysis that are related to or devolve from statistical problems. This has included looking at the distributions of heavy-tailed random variables, which is relevant for risk theory and extreme values of data, and at the relationship between discontinuous functions and their Fourier transforms, which was of interest for function estimation.

Recently I have focused attention on inference problems involving a large number of small data sets. Suppose, for example, that the distribution of data within different small data sets is the same up to location and scale, with location and scale differing randomly from one data set to the next. I am interested in methods for estimating the distribution common to all data sets, and also the distribution of location and scale across data sets. I have considered both frequentist (minimum distance) and Bayesian methods for tackling this problem. Another problem involving a large number of small data sets is testing the equality of distributions across all data sets. This is like the classical k-sample problem, but with the key difference that instead of fixing k and allowing sample sizes to increase without bound, I let k tend to infinity with sample sizes fixed. Doing so leads to different and interesting asymptotics in this and other inference problems. I am also interested in simulation methods that involve generating many different models randomly rather than generating large numbers of data sets from just a few models. I call this approach BayesSim since the distribution from which models are selected is analogous to the prior distribution in Bayesian methodology.

In the areas of hypothesis testing and variable selection, I am particularly interested in exploring efficiencies that can be gained through the use of non-local prior densities to specify either alternative hypotheses in hypothesis testing problems or the non-null distributions of regression coefficients in variable selection problems. My research on ordinal and rank data modeling finds application in evaluating the intelligence of non-human primate species and in educational assessment. Applied problems that currently interest me include statistical studies of the impacts of college admission policies on diversity of college campuses and graduation rates and developing more meaningful instruments to evaluate undergraduate and graduate teaching. More generally, I am interested in studying the impact that assessment procedures have on educational processes. Finally, I am intrigued by the problem of performing inference in agent models used in sociology and psychology.

As remote-sensing instruments mounted on satellites have made it possible to collect massive amounts of data on a global scale, much of my research focuses on the development of complex, flexible spatial methods that can be applied to big global datasets in a computationally feasible way. For example, I work with collaborators at NASA and NCAR on combining measurements from several satellites measuring CO2 on a global scale, on how to run related algorithms in parallel in modern distributed-computing environments, and on the real-time analysis of massive, streaming spatio-temporal datasets that are important for forecasting severe rainfall.

I am also interested in studying Bayesian model selection consistency under complex settings. Modeling the distributions of objects contained within images motivated some of my collaborative work, e.g., in applications of tumor tracking in targeted radiation therapy. More recently, I have become interested in building models for discovering patterns in large networks and to predict cognition from connectomics data.

The goal is to develop machinery for covariance matrices just like the powerful generalized linear models (GLM) for the mean vector developed over two centuries. The key ideas and tools I rely on are from prediction theory, time series analysis and theory of stochastic processes. My interest in applications includes financial data analysis, analysis of longitudinal and panel data, data mining, classification and clustering, fMRI and high-dimensional data.
