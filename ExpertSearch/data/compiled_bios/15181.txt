Moore Professor of Law Nancy E. Barton Scholar BA magna cum laude, Smith College JD, Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar, Columbia University Areas of Interest Legal Ethics, Torts Contact Office Room 1402F Email nmoore@bu.edu Phone 617-358-0501 Full CVSSRN Author Page Biography Professor Nancy Moore is a nationally recognized leader in the field of professional responsibility, an area in which she first became interested while working as a prosecutor in Philadelphia. Before joining Boston University School of Law in 1999, Professor Moore taught at Rutgers University School of Law, where she offered the schools first course in professional responsibility. Now is an exciting time to be teaching legal ethics, she says. Multi-disciplinary practice, multi-jurisdictional practice, lawyers and corporate scandals-lawyering in the 21st century raises a host of new challenges for our students. Professor Moore has written numerous articles on attorney ethics. Her most recent include Who Should Regulate Class Action Lawyers? (University of Illinois Law Review), What Doctors Can Learn From Lawyers About Conflicts of Interest (Boston University Law Review), Ethics Matters, Too: The Significance of Professional Regulation of Attorney Fees and Costs in Mass Tort Litigation (University of Pennsylvania Law Review) and The Ethical Role and Responsibilities of Lawyer-Ethicist: The Case of the Independent Counsels Independent Counsel for a 1999 symposium issue of the Fordham Law Review on The Independent Counsel Investigation, the Impeachment Proceedings, and President Clintons Defense. She was chief reporter for the ABA Commission on Evaluation of the Rules of Professional Conduct (Ethics 2000) and is chair of the Multi-State Professional Responsibility Examination Test Drafting Committee. She has served twice as chair of the Association of American Law Schools Section on Professional Responsibility and was an adviser to the American Law Institutes Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers.
