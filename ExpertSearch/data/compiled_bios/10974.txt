Faculty Andras Gyorgy Assistant Professor of Biomedical and Electrical Engineering Biomedical Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering Connect Prof. Andras Gyorgy and hisNetwork Dynamics and Synthetic Biology Group (NetBio)focuson the behavior of dynamicnetworks with particular emphasis on synthetic biology applications. Blending theory with experimentsthey look atrational forward-engineering of synthetic biology systems;characterization of circuit-circuit and host-circuit interactions both in vivo and in vitro; and thedesign and analysis of multi-scale systems prevalent in biology. Prior to joining NYUAD asan assistant professorin 2017,he was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Murat Arcak and Adam Arkin. Heconductedresearch on biological control and pattern formation. During his graduate studies at MIT, he focused on modularity in cellular systems blending theory with experiments in collaboration with Domitilla Del Vecchio, James J. Collins and Ron Weiss.
