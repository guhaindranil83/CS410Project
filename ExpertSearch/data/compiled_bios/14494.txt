Rhodes Hal 607/255-0629cel85@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyChristina Lee Yu (formerly Christina E. Lee) will be joining the faculty at Cornell in July 2018 as an Assistant Professor in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering. She is currently a a postdoc at Microsoft Research New England. She received her Ph.D. in 2017 and M.S. in 2013 in electrical engineering and computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems. She received her B.S. in computer science from California Institute of Technology in 2011. She is a recipient of the MIT Jacobs Presidential Fellowship, the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, and the Claude E. Shannon Research Assistantship.Research InterestsHer research focuses on designing and analyzing scalable algorithms for processing social data based on principles from statistical inference. She has recently studied similarity based neighbor methods for matrix estimation and community detection, showing that they can provide consistent estimates for very sparse data regimes within a flexible class of latent variable models. Applications for these algorithms include recommendation systems, low-cost crowdsourcing, social networks, and online marketplaces. She has also worked on developing scalable local algorithms for sparse matrix computations.AlgorithmsStatistics and Machine LearningData ScienceResearch Group MembersSelected PublicationsBorgs, Christian, Jennifer Chayes, Christina Lee, Devavrat Shah.2017."Thy Friend is My Friend: Iterative Collaborative Filtering for Sparse Matrix Estimation."
