Biography 01.Biography 02.Publications 03.Articles & Press About Academic Groups Operations Research and Statistics Academic Area Management Science Colin Fogarty is the Sarofim Family Career Development Professor and an Assistant Professor of Operations Research and Statistics at the MIT Sloan School of Management.Colin's research interests lie in the design and analysis both of randomized experiments, and of observational studies while assessing the robustness of a study's findings to hidden biases. Much of his work explores the extent to which classical randomization-based approaches for inference in experiments and observational studies extend to circumstances where heterogeneous treatment effects are suspected, as is common in practice. His work also illustrates tangible benefits for many quasi-experimental devices in terms of improved robustness to lurking variables in observational studies.Colin received his AB in Statistics from Harvard University and his PhD in Statistics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
