Such work requires discoveries about the processes involved in hearing as well as developing innovative engineering solutions. To serve these requirements, we use and advance knowledge in fields such as biomechanics, solid and fluid mechanics, acoustics, system identification and hearing physiology. The research portfolio of the Hearing Lab includes device development, advanced acoustic and vibration measurements and analysis in animal and human ears supplemented with analytical and computational modelling. Computational Metastasis Lab Computational Metastasis Lab is focused on developing predictive tools that enable personalized cancer treatments. The lab uses advanced computational mechanics algorithms in conjunction with clinical image processing in creation of the predictive tools. We measure data in vitro and in vivo in human and animals to validate our mathematical models of tumor-cell circulation, intravasation and extravasation using advanced optical methods and using clinical modalities.Research InterestsHearing ScienceAuditory MechanicsMedical DevicesHearing implantsDiganostic toolsBiomechanicsVibrationAcousticsOtolaryngologyComputational Fluid and Solid MechanicsPhysiological measurements and modellingCancer mechanicsMetastasisComputational OncologyEducation2017, Postdoctoral Fellowship, Postdoctoral Fellowship, Hearing Science and Technology, Otolaryngology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary2014, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, McGill University2000, Master of Applied Science, Mechanical Enginnering, Isfahan University of Technology1997, Bachelor of Applied Science, Mechanical Enginnering, University of TehranCourses*BME 252 - Linear Signals and SystemsTaught in 2018, 2019SYDE 252 - Linear Systems and SignalsTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsTang, Haimi and Razavi, Payam and Pooladvand, Koohyar and Psota, Pavel and Maftoon, Nima and Rosowski, John J. and Furlong, Cosme and Cheng, Jeffrey T., High-Speed Holographic Shape and Full-Field Displacement Measurements of the Tympanic Membrane in Normal and Experimentally Simulated Pathological Ears, Applied Sciences, 9(14), 2019Cheng, J.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
