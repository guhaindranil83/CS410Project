Favoring addressing scientific questions by a multidisciplinary approach, his research includes fieldwork, petrology, isotope geochemistry, structural geology, and major and trace element geochemistry. Particular interests include field studies on magmatic processes, magmatic accretion of continental crust in subduction zone, oceanic crust evolution, formation and evolution of the ocean-continent transition zone. At the undergraduate level Jagoutz studied Chemistry and Geology at the University of Mainz and as an Erasums student to ETH Zurich. After graduating in Geology (2000) he began a Ph.D. with J.P.Burg at ETH Zurich during which he spent three months at the Tokyo Institute of Technology with Shige Maruyama. On completion of his Ph.D. in 2004 Jagoutz worked as a postdoc with Othmar Mntener at the University of Bern. He joined the faculty in 2008. Fieldwork is central to Jagoutzs research: He usually spends around 3-4 months a year in the field and has extensive field experience in: Greece, Zimbabwe, Switzerland, Italy, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, Morocco and the western US.
