He was a leader in creating the Joint International Research Lab between GIT and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) and then served as its director for three terms. Dr. Ougazzaden worked in R&D as a senior researcher and group leader at CNET/France Telecom (France) for more than eight years and one year at Optoplus/Alcatel (France) as optoelectronic materials group manager. In 1999, he joined Bell-Labs at Lucent Technologies (USA) as epitaxy and materials characterization manager for Optical Fiber Communication.He kept this position with Agere Systems (USA), and then he worked as R&D and Fab Manager at TriQuint Semiconductor (USA). Dr. Ougazzaden joined Georgia Institute of Technology in 2005. His current research activity is in the field of wide bandgap semiconductors, 2D materials, and related devices for optoelectronic applications. He has authored more than 450 international scientific papers and communications and holds 26 patents.He contributed to the development of the first laser semiconductor at 1.3-micron for fiber telecommunication in France and its transfer to Alcatel.
