Lasheras Professor, Mechanical and Aerospace EngineeringFaculty-Affiliate, Bioengineering Turbulence and fluid mechanics with a special interest in two-phase flows. Mechano-biology. Mechanotransduction, Mechanics of cell migration and invasion. Medical devices. An aeronautical engineer by training, Professor Lasheras works at the intersection between medicine and engineering. His research interests include turbulent flows, two-phase flows and mechano-biology with special emphasis on the mechanics of cell migration and invasion. He conducts laboratory and mathematical modeling of flows relevant to a wide range of applications spanning from naval hydrodynamics to propulsion and vascular hemodynamics. He has studied the complex interaction between the mechanical stimuli and the pathophysiology of vessel remodeling responsible for the enlargement of cerebrovascular and abdominal aortic aneurysms. He currently works on several aspects of cell mechanics, including, cell mechano-transduction, cell migration and invasion. Capsule Bio: Juan C. Lasheras is the Stanford S. and Beverly P. Penner Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. He is a distinguished professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and Bioengineering, Director of the Center for Medical Devices and Instrumentation at the Institute of Engineering in Medicine, and Co-Director of the Master of Advanced Study program in Medical Device Engineering. Lasheras received the F.N. Frenkiel Award for Fluid Dynamics from the American Physical Society (APS) in 1990, and the 2003 Breakthrough Innovation in Medical Sciences given by BIOCOM. He is member of the National Academy of Engineering of the USA, the National Academy of Inventors of the USA, the Royal Academy of Engineering of Spain (Real Acadmia de Ingeniera de Espaa), and a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS). He was a Guggenheim Fellow and a George Van Ness-Lothrop Fellow and served in 2010 as the Chairman of the Division of Fluid Dynamics of the APS. He was awarded Doctor Honoris Causa degrees from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain in January 2011 and from the Universidad Politcnica de Madrid, Spain in October 2011. Lasheras holds 46 US patents in medical devices technology. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1982.
