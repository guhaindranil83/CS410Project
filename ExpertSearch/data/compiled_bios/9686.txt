I am in charge of research and development for the Solar Dynamics Observatory Content-Based Image Retrieval System. This system is designed to find similar solar images within the vast image repository of NASAs SDO mission. Current research work being done for this system involves using Lucene, deep learning, and other image retrieval and machine learning algorithms paired with computer vision techniques to find interesting regions within solar images. I also have an appointment as a postdoctoral data science fellow at Stanford Universitys Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, where I am a data-ninja/researcher at Shah Lab. In this lab, we look to uncover information hidden in the dark corners of the free-text sections of the EMR systems of Stanfords STRIDE data warehouse. I am in charge of maintaining and upgrading our text-tagging pipeline (based on Unitex) and our terminology resources. I am also responsible for curation of the multiple data sources/databases that Shah Labs researchers and collaborators have convenient access to. Another of my job responsibilities is writing production-quality code for publicly available tools developed by the lab and all the internal tools/scripts needed for day-to-day operations involving data processing, loading, and mapping. In my free time I am an avid mountain climber and music lover. As a data scientist, I work with large volumes of image data, extracting and transforming computer vision image features into large content-basedimage retrieval systems for NASAs Solar Dynamics Observatory mission.My interests are not limited to image data, however. I am also well-versed in extracting terms andclinical concepts from millions of unstructured electronic health records and using them to build predictive models (electronic phenotyping) and mine forpotential multi-drug interactions (drug safety). My interest in phenotyping includes leading the development of Aphrodite, a tool that allows researchers to build electronic phenotypes using fuzzy labels. Publications J. Banda, T. Kuhn, N.
