I was then a research associate at Duke for about a year. Prior to joining GSU, I spent about 10 years in industry research labs. My principal research interests lie in the area of machine learning and deep learning with an emphasis on high-performance computing. Im interested in developing efficient algorithms that can learn from a variety of data sources (e.g., image, audio, and text) on a large scale and automate decision-making processes in dynamic environments.
