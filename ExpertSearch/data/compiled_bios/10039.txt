She spent her Postdoc time in the Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Nebraska in Lincoln from 1999 to 2000. After returning to Germany, Eva Franke Schubert joined the Leibniz-Institute for Surface Modification in Leipzig and served in various positions. She joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at University of Nebraska in Lincoln 2006 and holds currently the position of an Assistant Professor. Professor Schuberts research interests are in the fields of ion beam processing and material fabrication for nano-electromechanic, magnetic and optical device applications. Eva Franke Schubert presented her research work in over 60scientific publications and 11 invited conference contributions, and received the Junior Faculty Award from University of Leipzig.
