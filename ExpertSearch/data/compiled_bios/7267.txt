'Toby' Bradshaw Professor Emeritus toby@u.washington.edu 044B PAA Bradshaw Lab website Not accepting graduate students Fields of interest Evolution & Systematics, Genetics and Genomics, Plant Biology Research Biography Related news Relevant publications My general area of research interest is the genetic basis of adaptive trait evolution in natural populations, especially as it relates to the origin of new species via plant-pollinator coevolution. I use a combination of laboratory, greenhouse/growth chamber, 3D-printed flowers, and field experiments to study adaptation. My academic background is largely in molecular biology and biochemistry, but I have a lifelong interest in organismal biology. I collaborate with ecologists, physiologists, and evolutionary biologists in many of my research projects. I am no longer accepting new graduate students or postdocs.
