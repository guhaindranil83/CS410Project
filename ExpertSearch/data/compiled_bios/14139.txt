Her research area is biogeochemical cycling in streams and rivers, including examining greenhouse gases and stable isotope analyses of nitrogen compounds. Contact informationOffice: EIT 1002Phone: 519-888-4567, ext. 38674Email: msrosamo@uwaterloo.ca Expertise Nitrogen cycling in streams and rivers, including use of natural stable isotope tracers Nitrous oxide and methane emissions and cycling in freshwaters Statistical analyses of large water quality datasets Phosphorus export from agricultural catchments Mathematically rigorous methods for selecting field sites Research Maddy's research focuses on nutrient cycling in streams in rivers. This includes controls on greenhouse gas production and emission in rivers, stable isotopic methods for determining the fate of nitrate in freshwater, and phosphorous losses through streams in agricultural landscapes. She has also examined statistical relationships between land use and nutrient losses across landscapes, and has recently been examining seasonal trends in nutrient cycling and methods for selecting field sites. Teaching Maddy is an International Lecturer for Water Sciences, teaching several courses in Wuhan, as well as several at the University of Waterloo. She is interested in adapting curricula to include experiential learning, focus on students' analytical skills, and to scaffold skills and concepts across courses in Earth & Environmental Sciences.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
