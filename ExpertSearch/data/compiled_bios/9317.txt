His research has focused on problems of ocean circulation and coupled climate dynamics involving interactions between motions on different scales, using theory, laboratory experiments, observations and new innovative approaches to global ocean modeling pioneered by his group at MIT. Current research interests include: ocean convection and subduction, stirring and mixing in the ocean, eddy dynamics and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the role of the ocean in climate, climate dynamics, aquaplanets. He joined the faculty in 1991. Publications Kyle C. Armour, John Marshall, Jeffery R. Scott, Aaron Donohoe & Emily R.
