I am the author of over 50 technical papers in bioinformatics, machine intelligence, and computational science. My research interests are in the areas of bioinformatics, normative reasoning and planning, DAI and multiagent systems, and computational chemistry. I have conducted research funded by NSF, NIH, NASA, DOD/ONR, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, BMFT (German NSF equivalent), as well as the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education. I have been a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Fellow. I was formerly the Director of the SC INBRE Bioinformatics Core. A major new focus of my research group is de novo peptide sequencing. We have recently received NSF funding to support this effort.
