Aerospace Engineering, University of VirginiaPh.D. Hydrodynamics Lab, Princeton UniversityPost-Doc Bio-Inspired Research and Design group, Stanford University Asst. Professor Quinn first came to the University of Virginia as an undergraduate student in 2006. After graduating with a BS in Aerospace Engineering, he attended Princeton University and completed a PhD in the Hydrodynamics Lab working on bio-inspired propulsion with Professor Lex Smits. Professor Smits nominated Professor Quinn for the American Physical Societys Andreas Acrivos Dissertation Award in Fluid Dynamics, which Quinn earned in recognition of his doctoral thesis,Optimizing the Efficiency of Batoid-Inspired Swimming.As a winner, he was invited to the Annual Meeting of the Division of Fluid Dynamics of the American Physical Society, where in November he will give an award lecture describing his PhD research. While at Princeton, Quinn was also a Visiting Fellow at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. He went on to become a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Bio-Inspired Research and Design group at Stanford University, studying the stability characteristics of birds flying in turbulent gusts. Professor Quinn joined the UVA faculty in the fall of 2016. He is a member of the Link Lab, a group of researchers studying Cyber-Physical Systems particularly autonomous vehicles, body sensor networks, and smart homes.
