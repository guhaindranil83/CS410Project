Keasling at UC Berkeley and the DOE Joint BioEnergy Institute. There, he developed design-driven approaches to engineer RNA-based genetic control devices for programming quantitatively-predictable functions in synthetic biological systems. James was a graduate student at Harvard, where he earned a Ph.D. with Jack W. Szostak. As a graduate student, he used information theory, in vitro selection, RNA biochemisty and 3D solution NMR to show that there may be a fundamental, quantitative relationship between the informational complexities of molecular structures and the functional activities they can perform. James has a B.S. in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from Yale. He has received the University of Washington Presidential Innovation Award and the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship.Outside the lab, he was a fellow of the Silicon Valley Startup Leadership Program (SLP), and enjoys backpacking, snowboarding, mountain biking, cooking BBQ ribs (native Tennessean), trail running with his adopted Boxer, and hiking with his son. Education Ph.D., Harvard University, Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, 2005 B.S., Yale University, Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, 1998 Previous appointments University of California, Berkeley, Jane Coffin Childs Research Fellow, 2006-2009 Research Statement The Carothers Research Group integrates quantitative RNA device design, dynamic control system modeling, and CRISPR-Cas network engineering for applications in synthetic biology. Our aims are to understand fundamental biological design principles and to engineer systems to meet demands for new sources of industrially- and medically-important chemicals and materials.
