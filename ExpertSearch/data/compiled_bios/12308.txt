Sloan Foundation Research Fellow (1988) Member of the Nano Institute of Utah Research Interests The theme of my research is nanoparticle surface chemistry, with activities in four main areas: Size-selected cluster deposition and size-effects on catalysis: Effects of electronic and geometric structure and cluster-support binding on activity. Effects of site size on electrocatalysis: Inherent effect of catalytic site size, aqueous electrochemistry without air exposure, high mass activity model electrodes. Single nanoparticle trapping mass spectrometry to study surface chemistry and optical properties with ppm size resolution: Size effects, new approaches to ultra-high temperature surface chemistry, light interactions with individual particles. Use of surface chemistry to control size and reactivity properties of high energy density nanoparticles for fuel/propellant applications: Reactant-assisted size reduction, air-stability via capping chemistry, effects of particle size, surface chemistry, and loading on ignition behavior.
