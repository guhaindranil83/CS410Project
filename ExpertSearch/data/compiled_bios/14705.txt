Dr. Allemang has been actively involved in the area of experimental structural dynamics and modal analysis for over forty years, pioneering the use of multiple input, multiple output estimation of frequency response functions, developing the concept of cyclic averaging, formulating the modal assurance criterion (MAC) and the enhanced frequency response function and reformulating modal parameter estimation algorithms into the unified matrix (coefficient) polynomial approach (UMPA). Dr. Allemang has served on the Advisory Board for the International Modal Analysis Conference (1981-2015, Chairman, 1986-1995) and on the Editorial Board of Sound and Vibration Magazine. Dr. Allemang has also served on the Executive Board of Society of Experimental Mechanics (SEM) from 1998-2006, including President for the Society during 2003-2004. Dr. Allemang is currently involved as Senior Collaborator for the AFRL Structural Sciences Center at WPAFB, working on the verification and validation (experimental quantification of margin and uncertainty) of experimental and analytical dynamic models and has been recognized by three professional societies as a Fellow (SEM, SAE and ASME). Dr. Allemang has also mentored two PhD graduates who went on to win Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE).
