David Lewin Professor Emeritus, Management and Organizations "Conflict is endemic in organizations because some people manage other people. How an organization manages such conflict affects employee retention and engagement, which in turn affect customer engagement and ultimately organizational performance. Hence, conflict management is at the core of modern human resource management theory and practice." david.lewin@anderson.ucla.edu About Biography Publications Research & Teaching Videos Biography David Lewin (B.S. '65, MBA '67, Ph.D. '71) is the author of many published works on such topics as human resource strategy, human resource management practices and business performance, workplace and organizational dispute resolution, unionism and collective bargaining and compensation and reward systems, including executive compensation and public sector compensation. His books include:Human Resource Management: An Economic Approach; The Human Resource Management Handbook, Parts I, II and III; The Oxford Handbook of Participation in Organizations; Contemporary Issues in Employment Relations; The Modern Grievance Procedure in the Unites States; The Labor Sector; Public Sector Labor Relations: Analysis and Readings; and Advances in Industrial and Labor Relations, Volume 24 (in press). His newest book is the Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods on Human Resource Management: Innovative Techniques. Lewin has also published more than 150 scholarly and professional articles in such journals as The Review of Economics and Statistics, Journal of Conflict Resolution, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Industrial Relations, British Journal of Industrial Relations, Criminology, Labor History, Human Resource Management, California Management Review, Harvard Business Review, Chicago-Kent Law Review and Employee Relations Law Journal. He presently serves on the editorial boards of Industrial Relations, California Management Review, Journal of Change Management and Work, and Organization and Employment, and he is senior editor of Advances in Industrial and Labor Relations. Lewin has recently called attention to the evolution of tournament-type pay systems in business enterprises, which are modeled on the distribution of prizes awarded to players in sports tournaments such as golf and tennis. From this perspective, relatively high pay/prizes go to a few top executives/players, whereas the bulk of employees/players receive comparatively low pay/prizes. In his teaching of MBA students as well as executives who attend UCLA Anderson's Corporate Governance and Mergers & Acquisitions executive programs, Lewin asks them to consider how tournament and other types of pay systems influence employee selection, retention and motivation, as well as organizational governance, culture and performance. Among his teaching awards are the Neidorf Decade Teaching Excellence Award and the Executive MBA program (EMBA) Outstanding Teaching Award. Lewin has held research grants from the National Science Foundation, Ford Foundation, National Institute for Dispute Resolution, Society for Human Resource Management, Human Resource Planning Society and the U.S. Department of Labor. He recently served as president of the Labor and Employment Relations Association (LERA) and presently serves as chair of the LERA Strategic Thinking Committee. He previously served as president of the University Council on Industrial Relations and Human Resource Programs (UCIRHRP), director of the UCLA Human Resources Round Table, director of the UCLA Institute of Industrial Relations, senior associate dean for the UCLA Anderson MBA program, faculty director of the UCLA Anderson Advanced Program in Human Resource Management, faculty director of the Columbia Business School Ph.D. program, faculty director of the Columbia Business School Human Resources Research Center, faculty director of the Columbia Business School Senior Executive Program, co-chair of former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordans task force on general manager compensation and performance evaluation and member of the board of directors of K-Swiss Inc. He presently serves as a director and fellow of the National Academy of Human Resources and is co-founder and continuing faculty member of the Columbia Business School/New York City Police Department Police Management Institute (PMI). Lewin is also a managing director of the Berkeley Research Group (BRG), where he serves as a testifying expert in labor and employment litigation. His current expert retentions involve disputes over no-poaching and noncompete agreements; the reasonableness of executive compensation; retaliatory termination; employee and managerial misclassification; independent contractor vs. employee status; and gender, race, age and disability discrimination. He has testified about these matters in federal, state and local courts, U.S. Tax Court, administrative law proceedings and arbitration proceedings. Education Ph.D., 1971, UCLA MBA, 1967, UCLA B.S.
