He is the founder and President of the Global Penguin Society (GPS, www.globalpenguinsociety.org), an international science-based conservation coalition dedicated to the survival and protection of the worlds penguin species. GPS has three inter-related components: science, management and education. He has spent 23 years in the field of marine conservation and his research focuses on different ecological aspects of seabirds relevant for conservation. In addition, he has taken direct action in conservation issues such as oil pollution in the southwest Atlantic, which created large scale problems for seabirds. Working for WCS and a GEF/UNDP project, Borboroglu coordinated and facilitated a community-based participatory process to design the first management plan for Punta Tombo, the world's largest and most accessible Magellanic Penguin colony. By coordinating 130 stakeholders, he created a commission to design and propose a marine protected area of 90,000 hectares adjacent to this colony. Additionally, he designed management plans for other sensitive coastal sectors to improve protected areas along the coast of Patagonia. With a strong recognition that improved stewardship of the ocean requires both science and communication to modify peoples attitudes and behavior, Borboroglu works extensively with international media. He has been a scientific advisor to Paramount Pictures, the Swedish and German National Television Channels, Tokyo Broadcasting System and Irish International Press, among others. Borboroglu studied biological sciences at the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco and received hisPh.D., with honors, in biology from the National University of Comahue in Argentina. He has received the Pew Fellowship in Marine Conservation 2009 and the Whitley Award 2010.
