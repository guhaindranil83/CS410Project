Engineering Department: Computer Science and EngineeringCollege of Engineering and Computing Email: songwang@cec.sc.edu Website: http://www.cse.sc.edu/~songwang/ Phone: 803-777-2487 Office: Room 2225, Storey Innovation Center Background Ph. D., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2002) Research Professor Wang's research interests include computer vision, medical imaging, and machine learning. Recently, his research is focused on developing computational algorithms and software tools for: understanding the natural images or image sequences by extracting perceptually salient structures, constructing statistical models for quantifying the nonrigid shape variation of anatomic structures, automatically and interactively segmenting structures of interest from various MR, CT, and microscopic images, detecting and recognizing objects of interest from images, detecting and recognizing human activities in videos.
