He received a Ph.D. degree in 2004 from the University of Maryland (College Park) in Electrical Engineering, and held a postdoctoral position in Princeton University from 2004 to 2007. His B.S. and M.S. degrees, both in electrical engineering, are from Tsinghua University in Beijing. Fumin Zhangs research focuses on mobile sensor networks that demonstrate bio-inspired long duration autonomy. He has contributed to the co-design of control, sensing, and communication algorithms for mobile sensing agents that collect information to model spatial temporal stochastic fields. An application domain of his research has been marine robots for environmental sensing and data collection. He has established a theoretical framework for the investigation of battery supported Cyber-Physical Systems. He also developed a co-design methodology for real-time scheduling, realtime control, and battery management. He is currently serving as the co-chair for the IEEE RAS Technical Committee on Marine Robotics and is the associate editor for IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, Robotics and Automation Letters, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, and IEEE Transactions on Control of Networked Systems. He also serves as the deputy editor-in-chief for the Cyber-Physical Systems Journal.
