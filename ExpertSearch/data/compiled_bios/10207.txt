Prior to coming to Northeastern, he was an engineer at Raytheon Company, working in coherent CO2 laser radar for remote sensing of the atmosphere and for other applications. At Northeastern, he continued laser radar activities, developed magnetic-field sensors based on the magneto-optical Kerr effect, and developed new optical techniques for landmine detection. More recently, his research has moved toward applications in medicine and biology. He invented optical quadrature microscopy for imaging phase objects, which has been used in research on embryo development. He also led the development of the Keck 3-D fusion microscope which combines optical quadrature with confocal and multi-photon microscopy for many applications in medicine and biology. He also pioneered novel techniques for medical imaging with ultrasound-modulated light.He teaches graduate courses in optics, and a variety of undergraduate courses including engineering design, electronics, and subsurface sensing & imaging. Prof. DiMarzios Optical Science Laboratory enjoys collaborations with CenSSIS, the Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems, with Prof. Carol Warners biology laboratory at Northeastern, and with the dermatology department at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.EducationPhD, Northeastern University, 1996 Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewOptics, microscopy, coherent detection, interaction of light and sound waves, hyperspectral imaging, diffusive optical tomography and ultrasound, landmine detection, magneto-optic sensors, and multi-model imaging.
