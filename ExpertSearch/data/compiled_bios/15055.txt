Shaughnessy Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science Professor Shaughnessy's research interests include analytical, experimental, and computational studies of flow problems arising in biology, medicine, and biotechnology as well as in more traditional mechanical engineering applications. Current research efforts include the effect of flow of non-Newtonian fluid properties on the flow separation near a tee junction representing a model of blood flow near a coronary artery graft; heat and momentum transfer near rough surfaces modeled by fractal distributions of surface roughness; the influence of flow on particle trajectories in electrostatic precipitators, inertial separators and aerosol sampling devices; and flow processes within or near deformable boundaries. The above work employs finite element based computational fluid dynamics using steady and transient simulations of 2-D and 3-D flow.
