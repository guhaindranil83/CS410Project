Small biological systems have evolved to utilize remarkable features for motion and locomotion; they achieve extraordinary accelerations, speeds, and forces that can be repeated with minimal costs throughout the life of the organism. I use analytical and computational models as well as physical prototypes to test hypotheses and explore bio-inspired designs. I develop advanced manufacturing techniques, leverage material properties to create embedded sensors and actuators, and explore device-environment interactions with various media and contact surfaces. In this multifaceted approach I investigate questions related to design, material selection, sensing, actuation, and locomotion of small-scale robots. Answering these questions will continue leading to novel small-scale robots, sensors, actuators, and power amplification mechanisms, which will translate into gains across both academia and industry, for applications such as milliscale surgical robots, search-and-rescue swarm robots, and space exploration.
