Teaching Interests Teaching Interests Aircraft and Rotorcraft Conceptual and Preliminary Design Novel Propulsion Concept Development Classical Aerodynamics Biography Biography I have an earned Ph.D. with more than fifteen years of experience in university teaching & research and more than twenty-nine years of industrial experience. This experience has been principally in the area of air vehicle conceptual and preliminary design and includes all aspects of air vehicles: fixed wing & rotary winged, civil & military (Navy, Air Force, & Army), manned & unmanned, and reentry vehicles. As a Professor in Practice, I am the primary lead in the development of the Vertical Lift/Rotorcraft Program in the MAE Department at UTA. To date we have successfully established the graduate program for both AE and ME graduate student with both degree programs and certificate programs. We are presently awaiting our first contracted award from the Us Army to teach new employees the nuances of rotorcraft/vertical lift as well as provide special professional development classes. I have been awarded more than 18 US patents in my name. Awarded 2017 MAE Most Valuable Faculty Award for outstanding service to the graduating class of 2017. As the Technical Fellow of Advanced Concepts for Bell/Textron, I provided the technical oversight of all new air vehicle developments, mentor and educate both senior management and staff in the conceptual design and innovation process and coordinate with external development entities (NASA, DoD, etc.) in new program and research developments. Formally, as Manager of Advanced Concepts, I directed over 20 major contracted and IR&D programs exceeding $80M and presently have a staff of 15 (primarily Staff Engineers, Sr. Staff Engineers & Scientist). In the past, my students have won both national graduate and undergraduate air vehicle design competitions and more than 15 AIAA student paper competitions. Many are presently employed within Preliminary Design within the aerospace industry (Lockheed, Boeing, Sikorsky, Bell, etc.).
