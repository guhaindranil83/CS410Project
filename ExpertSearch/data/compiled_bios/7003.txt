These include theoretical work on general issues and models in evolutionary dynamics, especially quantitative aspects, collaborations with experimental groups on laboratory evolution of microbes and on field studies of microbial diversity, improved methods for analysis of DNA sequence data to understand variations, and repertoire and dynamics of the immune system. Dynamics of cellular processes is also an active interest. Some collaborations with experimental neuroscience groups are being carried out. Condensed Matter Physics Research in theoretical condensed matter physics in recent years has included: dynamics of glasses, phase transitions and dynamics of quantum and classical disordered materials, and quantum dissipation in superconductors.
