Holly M. Smith Holly M. Smith Toggle navigation Department Faculty Holly M. Smith [home page] E-mail: hsmith@philosophy.rutgers.edu Holly M. Smith. Now Distinguished Professor Emerita of Philosophy at Rutgers University, she has also held appointments at Tufts University, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Michigan, the University of Illinois-Chicago, and the University of Arizona. She has published widely on topics in normative ethics, moral decision making, the theory of moral responsibility, and bio-medical ethics. In Making Morality Work (Oxford University Press, 2018), she explores how moral theories should accommodate the errors, ignorance, and misunderstandings that impede us as moral decision makers. Her current projects propose new strategies for weighing the stringency of deontological duties, and for identifying an agents alternatives in the context of normative theories.
