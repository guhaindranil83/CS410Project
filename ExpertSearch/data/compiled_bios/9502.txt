We apply these novel technologies to stem cell genomics, epigenomics, personal genomes and human common diseases. Capsule Bio: Dr. Kun Zhang is a Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the University of California San Diego. After obtaining his Ph.D. in Human and Molecular Genetics from the University of Texas at Houston/MD Anderson Cancer Center, he received his post-doctoral training with George Church at Harvard Medical School. He joined the faculty at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering in 2007. His current group is developing genome technologies based on single-molecule sequencing, single-cell manipulation/amplification, and chip-based synthesis and manipulation of complex DNA libraries. They are applying these novel technologies to the analyses of stem cells, human brain and other organs.
