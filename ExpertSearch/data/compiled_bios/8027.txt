I received my Ph.D. in computer science from Virginia Tech in 2020, where I developed computational models to better understand protein-ligand binding. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Research My research interest is in the intersection of computer science and life sciences with application domain in drug discovery. I apply mathematical/physics-based modeling, high performance computing (HPC) and data analytics techniques to simulate and understand biomolecular systems. With strong background in theoretical computer science, I also have interests in design and analysis of algorithms, particularly computational geometry.
