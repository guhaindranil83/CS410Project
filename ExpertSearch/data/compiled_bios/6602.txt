Frequently, however, it is in a region of nonlinear behavior that some form of automatic control is most needed. As an example, airplanes maneuvering at angles of attack near maximum lift often display unwanted characteristics such as nose slice and spin tendencies. Aside from the desire to eliminate these characteristics, there is a growing interest in extending the useful maneuvering capabilities of the airplane into these high angles of attack and beyond. Current research interests are aimed at finding control laws that remove the undesirable characteristics in these nonlinear flight regimes. This research is then be extended toward determining the control required to fully exploit the capabilities of an airplane to maneuver throughout its full envelope.
