Current Students PhD:Nanke Jiang MS:Chandra Prakash Gaddam, Sakina Junaghadwala, Nikai Zhang Biography Dr. Daniel Georgiev has been on the faculty of the University of Toledo's EECS department since Fall 2006. He received the equivalent of a M.S. degree in Engineering Physics (Quantum Electronics and Laser Equipment) from Sofia University, Sofia, Bulgaria in 1994, and a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering (Electronic Materials and Devices) from the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2003. Prior to joining the University of Toledo, he worked as a research faculty at the Center for Smart Sensors and Integrated Microsystems (SSIM), Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan. Dr. Georgiev's research has been funded by the NSF and industry. Recent Publications J.P. Moening, D.G. Georgiev, J.G.
