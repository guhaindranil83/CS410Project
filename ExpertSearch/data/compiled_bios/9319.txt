He has expertise on tectonic earthquakes in regional fault systems, as well as deformation and earthquakes induced by reservoir production. Hager earned his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1978 and then became a professor at Caltechs Seismological Laboratory. He joined MIT in 1989. He became the Director of the Earth Resources Laboratory (ERL) in June of 2012. Publications Tal, Y. and Hager, B. H.
