The spatial arrangement of these organisms changes with time by the colonisation of vacant rock surface, rather than seasonally. At any one time this pattern comprises patches representing various stages in the successional cycle after predat...ViewBenthic Faunal Zonation at a Subtidal Rock Ledge in the Central Gulf of MaineArticleJan 1985 Jon D.

ThomeViewWater flow and coral colony size: Interhabitat comparisons of the octocoral Alcyonium sideriumArticleFull-text availableOct 1984 Kenneth Peter SebensColonies of the octocoral Alcyonium siderium Verrill form aggregations on subtidal vertical rock walls in the Gulf of Maine. Maximum and mean colony sizes increase dramatically from protected embayments to sites exposed to ocean swells and from the bottom to the top of each vertical wall studied. Water movement along the substratum, generated by su...ViewPredation on zooplankton by the benthic anthozoans Alcyonium siderium (Alcyonacea) and Metridium senile (Actiniaria) in the New England subtidalArticleAug 1984 Kenneth Peter Sebens M. A. R. KoehlThe Alcyonacean octocoral Alcyonium siderium Verrill and the sea anemone Metridium senile (L.), the only common perennial zooplanktivores on shallow (16-m depth) subtidal rock walls in much of northern New England, USA, are of similar heights and overlap in their habitat and microhabit distributions. The coelenteron contents of both species were sa...View A Comparative Study of Sexual Reproduction in Three Species of Panamanian Zoanthids (Coelenterata: Anthozoa)ArticleFull-text availableJul 1984 Yusef H. Fadlallah Ronald H Karlson Kenneth Peter SebensColonies of Zoanthus sociatus, Z. solanderi, and Palythoa caribaeorum were sampled at 1-2 month intervals between December 1974 and April 1976 to determine their reproductive condition. Z. sociatus and P. caribaeorum exhibited seasonal patterns. Z. sociatus underwent gametogenesis from December 1974 through June 1975, and December 1975 through Marc...View Agonistic Behavior in the Intertidal Sea Anemone Anthopleura xanthogrammicaArticleFull-text availableJun 1984 Kenneth Peter SebensABSTRACT The large intertidal sea anemone,Anthopleuraxanthogrammica,(Brandt) forms aggregations of genetically distinct individuals at exposed,sites along the west coast of North America. Individuals are often in close tentacle contact and remain that way for several years. However, this species displays the same agonistic behavior, inflation, and...ViewMorphological Variability during Longitudinal Fission of the Intertidal Sea Anemone, Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt)ArticleApr 1984 Kenneth Peter SebensThe sea anemone Anthopfeura elegantissima forms clonal aggregations on rocky shores along the Pacific Coast of North America by a process of longitudinal fission. Fission can occur by lateral stretching of the column and separation of the two halves followed by internal regeneration of parts of the actinopharynx and of the column.
