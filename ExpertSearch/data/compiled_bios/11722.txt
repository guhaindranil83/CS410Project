Bard Ermentrout Distinguished University Professor, PhD I am interested in the applications of nonlinear dynamics to biological problems. My main focus is in the area of mathematical neuroscience where I try to understand the patterns of activity in networks of neurons. I model recurrent activity, waves, and oscillations in a variety of neural systems including olfaction (sense of smell), rat whisker barrels, cortical slices, and working memory. I am also interested in problems from physiology, immunology, and cell biology all of which I have modeled with students and postdocs.
