Robert Daasch Professor Emeritus Contact: daasch@pdx.edu Faculty Website:http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~daasch/ Education: Ph.D. University of Washington Research Interests: Digital and analog integrated circuit design and testing Built-in-self-test and built-in reliability circuitry Profile: I received my Ph.D. in 1982 from the University of Washington in Quantum Electronic Structure Theory a sub-discipline of Physical Chemistry. From 1982-1984, I was a Research Scientist at the University of Washington, Northwest VLSI Consortium. From 1984-1987, I was an Assistant Professor of ECE at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago IL. My post-doctoral position in the VLSI Consortium began the transition from physical science to engineering. To this day, the frequency and depth of the intersections between the two areas continues to amaze me. I joined the Portland State faculty in 1986 and in 1996 founded the Integrated Circuits Design and Test Laboratory. Currently, I am a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Co-Director of the ICDT Laboratory.
