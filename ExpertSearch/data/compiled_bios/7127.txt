He received his bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 1983. He did his graduate work at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where he earned his master's and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering in 1985 and 1988, respectively. He has been with Georgia Tech since 1988, where his teaching and research encompasses the theory and application of systems and control, with emphasis on electromechanics, electromobility, robotics, and sensing. Research interests: Nonlinear control systems Electromechanical systems and devices Optimization of manufacturing machines Automotive control systems Hybrid electric vehicles Sensor fusion Ultrasonic sensing Distinctions: NSF Research Initiation Award, 1989 NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award, 1991 Sigma Xi Research Awards (as thesis advisor) Outstanding Ph.D. Thesis, 1994 Outstanding Ph.D. Thesis, 2001 Outstanding M.S.
