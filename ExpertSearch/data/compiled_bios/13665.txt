Professor Fu and Professor Frank Saccomanno, also of UWaterloo, designed GradeX - a decision-support tool that can be used by railway safety engineers in Canada to identify crossing hotspots, evaluate countermeasures, and prioritize safety improvement projects. SimParatransit is another product of iTSS and has been has been playing a vital role in North America by providing equitable transportation service to the elderly and handicapped population, who have difficulty accessing regular public transit systems. Unlike regular fixed-route transit, paratransit commonly uses small to medium sized vehicles to provide shared-ride, door-to-door service with flexible routes and schedules. Professor Fu has contributed to several areas of intelligent transportation systems, public transit, road safety, and winter road maintenance. He has provided technical services to many transportation agencies, including Transport Canada, Ministry of Transportation Ontario (MTO), and several Canadian municipalities. Professor Fu is also the principal investigator of many winter snow and ice control related projects funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(NSERC), MTO, Landscape Ontario, and salt institute. Professor Fu has served on numerous technical committees of various professional organizations, such as the Transportation Research Boards Committee and the Editorial Advisory Board of the Journal of Transportation Research. Additionally, he was the past Chair of the Transportation Division of Canadian Society for Civil Engineering. As a result of his work, Professor Fu received the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC)'s 2011 Academic Merit Award for his long-term contribution to the development of the academic field.Research InterestsIntelligent transportation systemsTransportation planningSystem optimizationParatransit scheduling and service planningTraffic safety analysisWinter road maintenanceTraffic engineering and transport systems analysisTransportation EngineeringArtificial IntelligenceGeographical Information Systems (GIS)Public transportationsafety and winter road maintenanceShortest path algorithms for in-vehicle route guidance systemsTravel time modeling and estimation for advanced traveler information systemsConnectivity and Internet of ThingsOperational Artificial IntelligenceIoTApplication domainsEducation1996, Doctorate, Transportation Engineering, University of Alberta1987, Master's, Road and Traffic Engineering, Tongji University1984, Bachelor's, Road and Traffic Engineering, Tongji UniversityCourses*CIVE 444 - Urban Transport PlanningTaught in 2015, 2016CIVE 640 - Urban Transportation Planning Models: Principles & ApplicationsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019CIVE 343 - Traffic Simulation Modelling and ApplicationsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019CIVE 740 - Topics in Transportation EngineeringTaught in 2016, 2017, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsPing Huang, Javad Lessan, Chao Wen, Qiyuan Peng, Liping Fu, Li Li, Xinyue Xu, A Bayesian network model to predict the effects of interruptions on train operations, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, Volume 114, 2020, Pages 338-358 (Accepted in 2020)Chao Wen, Ping Huang, Zhongcan Li, Javad Lessan, Liping Fu, Chaozhe Jiang, and Xinyue Xu, Train Dispatching Management With Data- Driven Approaches: A Comprehensive Review and Appraisal, IEEE AccessChao Wen, Zhongcan Li, Ping Huang, Javad Lessan, Liping Fu and Chaozhe Jiang, Cause-specific investigation of primary delays of WuhanGuangzhou HSR, Transportation Letters, The International Journal of Transportation Research, 2019Kaur, J., T.
