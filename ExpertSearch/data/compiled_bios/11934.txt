He is also the Director of the Space Situational Awareness Arizona (SSA-Arizona) Initiative and currently the PI of the AFRL Cooperative Agreement. He published more than 50 peer-reviewed journal papers and more than 200 conference papers and abstracts. He is technical member of the AIAA Astrodynamics Committee and of the AAS Space Surveillance Committee. In 2010-2016, he was the systems engineering lead for the Science Processing and Operations Center of the NASA OSIRIS REx Asteroid Sample Return Mission. He is currently the lead for the target follow-up team of the recently selected NASA NEO Surveyor Mission. For his contribution to space missions, the asteroid 2003 WX3 was renamed 133474 Roberto Furfaro. Selected Publications Chapters Furfaro, R. (2011). ASTER imaging and analysis of glacier hazards.
