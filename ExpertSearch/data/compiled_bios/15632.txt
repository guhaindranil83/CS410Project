This page will continue to be maintained as her lab members complete their work. Education PhD, 1993, University of Vienna BS, 1989, Biology, University of Vienna Research Summary The Amon lab studies cell growth and division. They investigate how macromolecule biosynthesis is coordinated with cell division, and how chromosome segregation is is regulated by intracellular and extracellular cues. They also analyze the consequences of chromosome mis-segregation on cell and organismal physiology, and how these repercussions can lead to cancer and aging.
