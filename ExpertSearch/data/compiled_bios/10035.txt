In the News: Powered by the Oct 19, 2020: ECE faculty Chen & Varner honored for 55 years' service to university About Jerald Varner Dr. Varner received his Ph.D. from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in July of 1972. He has been a member of the faculty of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln since 1965 and is currently an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering. His research interests have largely been in the area of digital signal processing with applications to physiological signals. Since 1984, he has worked summers as a Visiting Researcher on the National Institutes of Health Campus in Bethesda, Maryland doing research related to the analysis of the electrical activity of the brain.
