Winslow (1937) Career Development Assistant Professor Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Assistant Professor of IDSS Research Interests:Machine learning, reinforcement learning, Large-scale optimization, Control theory, Multi-agent systems, Societal systems, urban systems, mobility systems, Implications of AI & automation ConnectMIT 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA, 02139 Email: cathywu@mit.edu Research website:https://wucathy.com/ Education UC Berkeley, EECS, Ph.D., 2018 MIT, EECS, M.Eng., 2013 MIT, EECS, B.S., 2012 Research InterestsCathy works at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and large-scale societal systems. Her recent research focuses on mixed autonomy systems in mobility, which studies the complex integration of automation such as self-driving cars into existing urban systems. She is interested in developing principled computational tools to enable reliable and complex decision-making for critical societal systems. Throughout her career, Cathy has collaborated and worked broadly across fields, including transportation, computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, urban planning, and public policy, and institutions, including Microsoft Research, OpenAI, the Google X Self-Driving Car Team, AT&T, Caltrans, Facebook, and Dropbox. As the founder and Chair of the Interdisciplinary Research Initiative within the ACM Future of Computing Academy, she is actively building international programs to unlock the potential of interdisciplinary research in computing.
