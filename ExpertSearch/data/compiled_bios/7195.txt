Paris Professor Technical Interest Groups: Optics and Photonics Email address:email Fax:33 3 87 20 39 40 Office:GTL Overview Distinctions & Awards Publications & Patents Dr. Voss received the B.A. degree in Humanities with an emphasis in French Literature from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah in 1994. In 1997, he received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. He was awarded the M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 2000 and 2003, respectively. After pursuing postdoctoral studies at Northwestern University, he joined the Georgia Tech faculty in January 2006. His research has involved experimental and theoretical study of optical amplifiers that make use of nonlinear mixing to provide gain. These amplifiers, called fiber parametric amplifiers, can also wavelength convert signals. In addition, they can also serve as sources of entangled photons for quantum key distribution. Dr. Voss has identified theoretically and verified experimentally the fundamental limits on the performance of these devices for optical communications and quantum key distribution. He also developed ultrasensitive detection techniques for photon counting and quantum optical homodyne tomography. His research at Georgia Tech involves the development of novel and improved devices and systems for optical communications and for quantum communications. In his short career, he has authored or co-authored more than 50 publications and conference presentations and holds 1 patent.
