He was the Chairman of the department during 1989-1992. He had a joint appointment with the department of Mathematics. He has graduated more than 35 M.Sc and 25 Ph.D. students. Professor Ahmed is an author of 8 graduate and post graduate level books which are known to specialists around the world. They cover systems governed by ordinary differential equations, integro-differential equations, partial differential equations, stochastic differential equations and abstract differential equations on Banach spaces etc. His research level books are widely studied by specialists. He is also the author of 350 scholarly papers in the field of systems, control, filtering and communication including stochastic systems and their control and stability. His interest is broad covering all mathematical aspects of science, engineering, operation research etc. He has published papers on the dynamics of satellites, space station, suspension bridges, power system network, fluid dynamics, artificial heart, vehicular traffic model, internet traffic model and flow control etc. He has given more than 15 plenary talks in international conferences. He gave several invited talks at the Banach Center in Warsaw and also many talks at special sessions of the AMS. He is a member of the Editorial Board of more than 12 international journals. His current interest is in the field of infinite dimensional systems governed by neutral stochastic systems and their optimal control.
