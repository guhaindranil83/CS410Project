Donald Morrison Professor Emeritus, Marketing My vision for the Morrison Family Center is that it provide a very significant bridge between first-rate marketing academic work and serious practitioners in the industry. donald.morrison@anderson.ucla.edu (310) 825-7706; (310) 825-0003 About Biography Publications Recognition Video Biography Don Morrison came to UCLA Anderson in 1988 after 22 years at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University. Morrison is the author or co-author of more than 90 articles in refereed journals with special emphasis on marketing research and applied statistics. He has served as an expert witness as a statistician in a number of legal cases and a consultant to industrial firms and governmental agencies. He is co-author of the book Stochastic Models of Buying Behavior, with William F. Massey and David B. Montgomery. Morrison has held numerous editorial positions with INFORMS, such as departmental editor, editor in chief of Management Science and founding editor of Marketing Science. He has also served as president of the Institute of Management Sciences, an academic trustee of the Marketing Science Institute and a member of the review panel for the National Science Foundation. Morrison has served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Marketing Research and the Journal of Marketing. Morrisons most important and rewarding academic contribution is the advising and mentoring he has done with 18 Ph.D. students. Eight of these students currently hold endowed chairs in top marketing departments at universities across the country. On teaching and developing doctoral students at UCLA Anderson, Morrison said, You give them roots and then wings; its rewarding to watch them grow as scholars. Now a professor emeritus, Morrison maintains his involvement with UCLA Anderson in number of ways. He is still active as a member of the schools FEMBA and EMBA admission committees, is a member of the schools Centennial Campaign committee and still serves as the unofficial curator of Andersons art collection. He and his wife, Dr. Sherie Morrison, are generous benefactors of UCLA Anderson. Their $10 million gift launched the schools Morrison Family Center for Marketing Studies and Data Analytics and is the single largest gift ever from an Anderson faculty member. The Morrison Family Center is a leading center for the creation and dissemination of marketing knowledge for the digital age. Our whole family feels very connected to Anderson, Morrison says, noting that his two daughters Heather Felix (94) and Michelle Oliva (95) are both alumnae. Sherie and I feel very much a part of the Anderson community, we are engaged with all things Anderson. We feel very blessed to be able to give back to the school. The Morrisons also maintained a close relationship with Marion Anderson, widow of John Anderson, whose $100 million gift in part has led to the construction of the yet-to-open Marion Anderson Building. The Morrisons have donated an additional $1 million toward the project, and the boardroom in the building will be named for them. In addition to his roles at UCLA Anderson, Morrison is a trustee of Hotchkiss and Wiley and on the advisory board for Northern Trust.

Recognition Morrison was inducted in 2003 (along with two UCLA Anderson colleagues, Arthur Geoffrion and William Pierskalla) as an inaugural fellow of INFORMS, the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. Also in 2003, Morrison received the J. Clayburn La Force Faculty Leadership Award for UCLA Anderson School of Management. For his dedication as a teacher, Morrison was presented with the 2002 American Marketing Association/Irwin/McGraw-Hill Distinguished Marketing Educator of the Year Award the highest honor a marketing educator can receive. The primary criterion for this award is that its recipient be universally acknowledged as a long-standing leader in marketing education. The American Marketing Association also honored Morrison in 2001, when he received the groups Gilbert A. Churchill Award for Lifetime Achievement in Marketing Research. Presented annually by the AMA Marketing Research Special Interest Group, the Churchill Award honors the academic researcher who has contributed in an exceptionally significant way to the field of marketing research. To celebrate that honor, in January 2002 the Charles E. Young Research Library (YRL) spotlighted Donald Morrison and his academic achievements in an exhibit, which featured his biography and a selected bibliography of his scholarly work, along with books, journals and photographs.
