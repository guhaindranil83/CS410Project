Sohrab, A Modified Hydro-Thermo-Diffusive Theory of Shock Waves, WSEAS Transactions on Heat and Mass Transfer (2007) In the Classroom Professor Sohrab has taught both graduate and undergraduate courses on combustion as well as courses on thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. His teaching philosophy places great emphasis on deep intuitive understanding of physical concepts from their most primitive and conceptually accessible roots from direct empirical human experience and perception.Also, care is taken to clearly reveal the connections between the observed concrete physical phenomena and abstract mathematical symbolism and description used to model such physical phenomena. In addition, historical facts and perspectives are provided for appreciation of the evolution of the subject matter from it inception thus allowing the students to recognize the broader human and social aspects of scientific discoveries and the important roles of both successes as well as failures in the ultimate development of scientific laws and the inter connections between various scientific disciplines such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, statistical mechanics, heat and mass transfer, combustion, electrodynamics and radiation.
