He holds a BSc in Chemical Engineering and BSc in Mathematics from Colorado School of Mines, MS in Chemical Engineering from the University of Colorado-Boulder, and PhD in Chemical Engineering from Purdue University West Lafayette, Indiana. The goal of his research program is to develop theory and applications for process systems engineering. The applications are focused on planning and scheduling of process operations, energy production, pollution monitoring and control, waste minimization, carbon management, sustainable operations, molecular design, and product formulation. Professor Elkamel teaches graduate and undergraduate courses on optimization techniques, mathematical methods for chemical engineers, applied statistics, numerical methods, systems engineering, and engineering economy. Prof. Elkamel supervised over 90 graduate students (of which 35 are PhDs) and more than 30 post-doctoral fellows/research associates and his trainees all obtain good jobs in the chemical process industry and in academia. He has been funded for several research projects from government and industry. Among his accomplishments are the Outstanding Faculty Award, the Best teacher award, the IEOM (Industrial engineering and Operations Management) Outstanding Service and Distinguished Educator Award, UAE MBR Academy of Scientists, The Engineering Research Excellence Award, and Excellence in Graduate Supervision Award. He has been on the program and organization committees of many international conferences. Prof. Elkamel has a strong track record of research excellence. He published over 330 journal articles, 145 proceedings, and 33 book chapters, and has been an invited speaker on numerous occasions at academic institutions throughout the world and at national and international conferences. He has also written 5 books, including Environmentally Conscious Fossil Energy Production, Planning of Refinery and Petrochemical Operations, and Electric Vehicles in Energy Systems: Modelling, Integration, Analysis, and Optimization.Research InterestsProcess Systems Engineeringplanning and scheduling of process operationssupply chain managementproduct and process designpollution prevention and waste minimizationwaste utilization and managementplanning for energy productionrobust optimizationsoft computingEnergy and Environmental Engineering SystemsAir Pollution ModelingSimulation and ControlRefinery modelingplanning and optimizationSustainable Development of the Petrochemical IndustryDynamic Modeling and OptimizationCombinatorial OptimizationUncertainty in OptimizationProcess Modeling and SimulationComputer-Aided Product Formulation and DesignEducation1993, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, Purdue University1989, Master's, Chemical Engineering, University of Colorado-Boulder1987, Bachelor's, Chemical Engineering, Colorado School of Mines1987, Bachelor's, Mathematics, Colorado School of MinesCourses*CHE 755 - Res Topics in Electrochemical Engineering, Interfacial Eng & Material ScienceTaught in 2015CHE 482 - Chemical Engineering Design WorkshopTaught in 2015, 2016CHE 775 - Research Topics in Environmental Engineering and Pollution ControlTaught in 2015CHE 220 - Process Data AnalysisTaught in 2016CHE 725 - Research Topics in Analysis of Chemical ProcessesTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017CHE 322 - Numerical Methods for Process Analysis and DesignTaught in 2015, 2016CHE 720 - Special Topics in Analysis of Chemical ProcessesTaught in 2016CHE 571 - Industrial EcologyTaught in 2016NE 215 - Probability and StatisticsTaught in 2016, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsAl-Sobhi, Saad A and Elkamel, Ali and Erenay, Fatih S and Shaik, Munawar A, Simulation-Optimization Framework for Synthesis and Design of Natural Gas Downstream Utilization Networks, Energies, 11(2), 2018Rizwan, Muhammad and Saif, Yousef and Almansoori, Ali and Elkamel, Ali, Optimal processing route for the utilization and conversion of municipal solid waste into energy and valuable products, Journal of Cleaner Production, 174, 2018, 857 - 867Izadpanah, Mahsa and GHeshlaghi, REZA and Mahdavi, Mahmood Akhavan and Elkamel, Ali, Effect of light spectrum on isolation of microalgae from urban wastewater and growth characteristics of subsequent cultivation of the isolated species, Algal Research, 29, 2018, 154 - 158Hourfar, Farzad and Salahshoor, Karim and Zanbouri, Hosein and Elkamel, Ali and Pourafshary, Peyman and Moshiri, Behzad, A Systematic Approach for Modeling of Waterflooding Process in the Presence of Geological Uncertainties in Oil Reservoirs, Computers & Chemical Engineering, 2018Kundu, Prodip K and Elkamel, Ali and Vargas, Francisco M and Farooq, Muhammad U, Genetic algorithm for multi-parameter estimation in sorption and phase equilibria problems, Chemical Engineering Communications, 2018, 1 - 12Alie, C., Elkamel, A., Douglas, P.L. and Croiset, E., Reduced-order modelling of flexible CCS and assessment using short-term resource scheduling approach, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, 48, 2016, 253 - 274Mohammed Alkatheri, Ali Elkamel and Peter L Douglas, Data-driven Power Generation Design and Operation Under Demand Uncertainty, 4th North American Conference on Industrial Engineering & Operations Management, 10 2019, Toronto, Ontario.
