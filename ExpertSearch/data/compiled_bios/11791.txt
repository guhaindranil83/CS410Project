He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the cole polytechnique fdrale de Lausanne in 2016. As a postdoctoral associate, he led a team of graduate students that first demonstrated quantum-enhanced force measurement using quantum correlations generated in a room-temperature interferometer. He was the first to achieve the measurement of the position of a macroscopic object with the minimum noise allowed by the principles of quantum mechanics. His current interests, pursued in the LIGO Laboratory at MIT, are to scale-up quantum metrology techniques to gram-scale oscillators, quantum technologies based on mechanically-compliant interferometers, and to develop mechanical systems that allow for probes of basic physics of motion. Vivisheks work has been recognized by a Best Poster Award at the International Conference on Laser Spectroscopy (2015), an EPFL Best Thesis Prize (Photonics, 2017), and a Swiss National Science Foundation Fellowship (2018).
