Vesselin Shanov is a Professor with the Chemical Engineering program at the School of EEBME and the co-founder and co-director of the teaching and research facility NANOWORLD Lab at the University of Cincinnati. He has over 30 years of academic and industrial experience in research and development related to technologies and facilities for processing of advanced materials and thin films. Dr. Shanov has been a tenured associate professor at the University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy, Sofia, Bulgaria, where he also served as an advisor to over 40 graduate students. He has taught eighteen courses at the University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy, Sofia, Bulgaria and eighteen courses at the University of Cincinnati. His recent research focuses on synthesis, characterization, processing, and application of nanostructured materials with emphasis on carbon nanotubes, graphene, as well as on biodegradable Mg for medical implants. Applications of his research are in the areas of electronics, aerospace, and nanomedicine. Dr. Shanov has more than 300 scientific publications, including 16 patents, 12 provisional patents, and 5 books, cited in about 3,200 different references. Currently, he collaborates with faculties from UC Colleges of Medicine, Applied Science, and Engineering, Oklahoma State University, North Carolina A&T State University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Hannover Medical School-Germany. The latter 3 universities, along with UC, are involved in the NSF Engineering Research Center for Revolutionizing Metallic Biomaterials. Teaching Summary, Taught 25 different courses (listed below) in Materials and Chemical Engineering at two universities; incorporated nanotechnology research into the engineering curricula at UC; teaches advanced topics in Chemical and Materials Engineering in the undergraduate Tech Lab Class, such as: Renewable Energy (Solar Cell, Hydrogen Fuel Cell), Nanotechnology (Carbon Nanotubes and related Nanodevices), Modern Analytical Instrumentation, Vacuum and Plasma Technologies, etc. Considers undergraduate students (UG) research to be a very important tool for teaching engineering, as well as for student retention; works on an individual basis with undergraduate students in the research lab; 3 of my undergraduate students won national aerospace awards for research. Believes teaching through the respected program at UC Research Experience for Middle and High School Teachers is a powerful outreach approach that indirectly helps recruit young adults in the field of science and engineering; involved in a 3 year NSF project as Co-PI (Prof. A. KukretiPI) and collaborates with Cincinnati School District teachers at UC by teaching a topic on Renewable Energy. Hosts tours of Nanoworld Lab; more than 1,000 students, parents, industry professionals, faculty and Government representatives visit Nanoworld each year; the Nanoworld Lab website is one of the most frequently visited websites at UC. Hosts weekly lab tours at the College for recruiting prospective students which include presentations on the latest achievements in renewable energy, nanotechnology and other science fields.
