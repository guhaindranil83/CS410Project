Beforejoining RPI, he was an Assistant Professor in Chemical Engineering at the Universityof South Carolina (USC) from 2012 to 2017. He was an Assistant Research Professor inChemical Engineering at the University of Colorado, Boulder (CU-Boulder) from 2010to 2012. He obtained B.S. (1998) and M.S. (2002) degrees from Tianjin University, China.He earned his Ph.D. degree from CU-Boulder in 2007, and subsequently worked in thesame department as a postdoctoral researcher from 2007 to 2010. Dr. Yus current research is focused on precisely distinguishing size/shape differences of molecules by rationally designing and fabricating nanoporous coatings and membranes, and exploring their applications on energy and environment. Current active research directions include CO2 capture from flue gas, natural gas purification, H2 production from NH3 production, dimethyl ether (DME) production from renewable sources, crude oil separation using microporous ceramic membranes, ultrathin graphene-based membranes for water purification, and zeolite composites for adsorptive separation and catalysis.
