The research topics include a combination of fundamental science exploration, engineering design and optimization, devices fabrication and characterization, and various applications. Lius work has been in the emerging field of plasmonics (optics at nanoscale) and metamaterials (artificial materials with unprecedented properties). He has been a principal driver of pioneering research in developing new concepts, devices and techniques, such as far-field superlens, optical hyperlens, tunable plasmonic lens, 3D metamaterials for optical negative refraction, and plasmonic interference lithography. Current research directions include high speed and high spatial resolution bioimaging and sensing, light control at nanoscale using plasmonic structures, development of novel nanofabrication techniques and bio-photonics. Capsule Bio:Zhaowei Liu is an assistant professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC San Diego. His interdisciplinary research focus includes nanophotonics, plasmonics, nanomaterials and life science. Lui received his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering (MEMS/Nanotechnology) from UCLA in 2006. Before joining the Jacobs School faculty, Liu was a post-doctoral researcher at the NSF Nanoscale Science & Engineering Center (NSEC) in the Mechanical Engineering Department at UC Berkeley.
