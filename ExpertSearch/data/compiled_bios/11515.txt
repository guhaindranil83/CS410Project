Video Link: https://vimeo.com/331322010 Sept 2018 University of Texas at Arlington Magazine Fall 2018 Ashfaq Adnan, associate professor of mechanical engineering, and his postdoctoral associate Yuan Ting Wu published research on traumatic brain injury in Nature's Scientific Reports. Their work revealed that battlefield blasts may cause cavitation (tiny bubbles) in the brain's perineuronal nets, which may collapse and cause neuronal damage. Feb 2018 INQUIRY Spring 2018 issue of UTA's inquiry magazine highlighted our work on brain injury. Jan 2018 BLAST, BUBBLE AND BRAIN INJURY Ashfaq Adnan, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), and his postdoctoral associate Yuan Ting Wu published research findings in Nature Scientific Reports in July 2017 revealing how battlefield blasts may cause bubbles in the brain's perineuronal nets which, in turn, may collapse and damage neurons. Jan 2018 National Science Foundation Researchers at the University of Texas at Arlington used supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center to simulate how bubbles caused by explosions may damage neurons in the brain. Using similar methods, the team reported in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society how nanoparticles affect the fragility of ceramic materials used in space shuttles. They found that the conventional wisdom that nanoparticles improve material strength is not necessarily guarantee Jan 2018 UTA associate professor awarded grant to research head trauma, disorders The Office of Naval Research gave a UTA professor a grant to research the connection between blast-like trauma and neurological disorders. Ashfaq Adnan, mechanical and aerospace engineering associate professor, has been given this $613,079 grant, and it will cover three years worth of research.

Admission is free. Mar 2016 Researchers study how shock waves affect the brain A mechanical and aerospace engineering professor has received a grant to work on a computer simulation system to study how neurons in the brains of soldiers are affected after a battlefield blast. Ashfaq Adnan and his research team are working to create a computer model with an atomistic stimulation system, Adnan said. Adnan received a three-year, $380,586 grant through the Office of Naval Researchs Warfighter Performance Department and UTA. Feb 2016 Engineering researcher wins Naval Research support to measure when and how battlefield blasts injure brain neurons A University of Texas at Arlington engineering researcher supported by the Office of Naval Research is developing a computational model to measure how and when battlefield blasts can cause devastating damage to neurons in the brain. Jan 2016 UTA Inquiry Sp 16: MATERIAL WORLD MAKING CERAMICS STRONGER Attractive properties such as strength, hardness, durability, and resistance to corrosion have made ceramics a popular choice for a wide variety of applications, from kitchen knives and car brake pads to hip replacements and microprocessors. But its their high heat tolerancesome ceramics have a melting point of over 3,000 degrees Celsiusthat makes them truly unique. Sept 2013 Research project hopes to make Texas highways safer At UTA, a school comprised of 85 percent commuter students, according to UTAs website, some researchers are saying highway safety and efficiency is no less than vital. When you make the road above the surface, there are two sides that are sloping down, said Ashfaq Adnan, aerospace and mechanical engineering assistant professor, who also worked on the project. These pins just lock the slippery soil into place. They act as a resisting force against the clay soil. Sept 2012 Assistant professor shares osteoporosis research Anyone who has seen a Life Alert commercial knows the frigidity human bones take on as they age. Ashfaq Adnan, assistant mechanical and aerospace engineering professor, is working on ways to understand the science behind this phenomenon.
