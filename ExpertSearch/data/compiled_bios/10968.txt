Faculty Jeremy Teo Assistant Professor of Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering Biomedical Engineering Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Connect ProfessorJeremy Teo is directing theLaboratory for Immuno Bioengineering Research and Applications (LIBRA) at NYU Abu Dhabi.His research interests lie in immune-mechanobiology, focusing on the implications of natural and synthetic microenvironmental cues in downstream immune biology. By depicting the mechanisms of these intricate signals through basic research using he aims to apply the knowledge towards the possibility of modulating immune outcome using bioengineering strategies. Prof. Teo received his PhD from the School of Medicine, National University of Singapore with thesis work focusing on integrating interventional radiology with engineering, providing science to an artwork. He holds a Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering and a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the same University, as well as a Technical Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore. His experience with biological sciences came from his postdoctoral training at the cole Polytechnic Fdral de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland: Lymphatic and Cancer Bioengineering, Swartz Lab) and Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (IBN, Singapore: Kidney Tissue Engineering/Biomaterials). He also has six years of undergraduate and graduate teaching experience from Khalifa University of Science and Technology where he was part of the inaugural team of Biomedical Engineering faculty members.
