Faculty Jef D. Boeke Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology Professor of Biomedical Engineering Biomedical Engineering Connect Director of the Institute of Systems Genetics Member NAS, AAA&S The laboratory of Professor Jef Boeke is well known for foundational work on mechanistic and genomic aspects of retro-transposition in both yeast and mammalian systems. In addition, the Boeke lab is heavily involved in the development of novel technologies in genetics, genomics and synthetic biology.Hisgroup uses yeast as a platform for exploring the construction of fully synthetic chromosomes for practical and theoretical studies. Theyhave congregated an international consortium called SC2.0 to rewrite and synthesize the first eukaryotic organism,Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We project complete synthesis and debugging of the entire genome by the end of 2020.
