Current Students PhD:Wei Wei, Majed M. Albogame MS:Stephanie Parrott, Philip Iyambo, Mohammed Altamash, Miraj Mainali, Bhagyashree Naik Biography Junghwan Kim received the B.S degree in Electronics Engineering from Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea in 1975, and the M.S and the Ph.D degrees in Electrical Engineering (major: Spread spectrum and Satellite communications) from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI&SU), Blacksburg, VA, U.S.A in 1985 and 1988 respectively. He worked as an electronics engineer developing electronic telephone switching system (ESS) in Korea for 8 years. In Fall 1988, he joined the faculty at the University of Toledo and is currently a professor and the director of communication research laboratory. He was the recipient of 2009 EECS department faculty Research award, 2009 College of Engineering Excellence award, and 2015 Teacher of the year award. From 2005 to 2008, he served as an EECS graduate program director. He is a senior member of IEEE and currently serves as an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting since 2001. Dr. Kim secures numerous external funding in his research areas of tactical satellite communications, network architecures, and FEC coding from NASA, NSF, Korean government agencies, and industries in U.S and Korea including Samsung and LG. He is selective in publication and published papers in journals including IEEE Transactions on Communications, Wireless Communications, Vehicular Technology, Broadcasting, and Aerospace and Electronic Systems and the most prestigious IEEE international conferences.
