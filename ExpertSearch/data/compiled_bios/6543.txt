Boeing Department of Aeronautics & Astronautics in the summer of 2015. Formerly, he was a postdoctoral research scholar (2013-2014) and later a Research Assistant Professor (2014-2015) in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Northwestern University.Prof. Salviatos research interests are in the areas of Mechanics of Solids and Fracture Mechanics. His research focuses on understanding the mechanical behavior of materials and structures atmultiple scalesthrough the formulation of advanced computational and analytical approaches and new experimental techniques. His objective is developing computational and analytical tools to assist the design of lighter aerospace and automotive structures with improved manufacturability, damage tolerance and structural stability and integrity.
