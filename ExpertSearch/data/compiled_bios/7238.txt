After graduation, Dr. Lee joined Verbex Corporation where he conducted research on connected word recognition. In 1984, he became affiliated with Digital Sound Corporation where he was engaged in research and product development in speech coding, speech synthesis, speech recognition and signal processing. From 1986 to 2001, he was with Bell Laboratories where he became a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff and Director of the Dialogue Systems Research Department. In August 2001, he accepted a one-year appointment as a visiting professor at the National University of Singapores School of Computing. He joined the ECE faculty in September 2002. Dr. Lee has published more than 250 papers and holds 25 patents. He edited the book Automatic Speech and Speaker Recognition: Advanced Topics, and has contributed chapters to ten books.
