MIFODS is focused on the intersection of mathematics, statistics and theoretical computer science. He received a PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University, advised by Karthik Sridharan, in 2018. His research focuses on theory for machine learning in real-world settings, where data is too large to fit in memory or where there are constraints on computation or information. He is currently working on problems in interactive learning, deep learning and generalization. Dylan received his BS and MS in electrical engineering from USC in 2014 and was a recipient of the NDSEG fellowship.
