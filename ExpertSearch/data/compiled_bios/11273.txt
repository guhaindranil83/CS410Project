Stanford University B.S.E.E. Montana State University (with Distinction) Research Interests: Biologically Inspired Computing, algorithms and implementation Biologically Inspired Machine Learning Profile: From 1977 to 1980, Dr. Hammerstrom was an Assistant Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department at Cornell University. In 1980 he joined Intel in Oregon, where he was involved in computer architecture and VLSI design. In 1988 he founded Adaptive Solutions, Inc., which specialized in high performance silicon technology (the CNAPS chip set) for image processing, neural network emulation, and pattern recognition. In 1998 he joined the Oregon Graduate Institute, and then moved to Portland State in 2005. Dr. Hammerstrom was a Program Manager at DARPA from March 2012 to March 2016. He has been a Visiting Scientist at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden and the NASA Ames Research Center. He currently has a joint faculty appointment with Halmstad University, Halmstad Sweden. Professional Affiliations: IEEE Life Fellow Awards and Recognition: March 2016 Dr. Hammerstrom was awarded the Office of the Secretary of Defense Medal for Exceptional Public Service.
