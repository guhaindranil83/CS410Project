During the year it took to complete my BS in Speech Communication, I realized I liked the education gig and completed myMA in Communication., but not before my faculty mentors at the University of Texas at Tylerguided (brainwashed)me toward a PhD.In 2014, the original 3 Deasons moved to Indianapolis... .along the journey, we added 4 more ninjas. After 6 years, I completed my PhD in Health Communication at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis in July 2020. My dissertation,Im Fine:Systemic Affect of Critical Incidents in Emergency Medical Service personnel Communication(fancy shmancy title, right)explores how the bad calls and thug life shape EMS communication. I use a qualitative lens to focuses on mental health (iePTSD, depression, anxiety) and communication in Emergency Personnel. My soul is happy when I can translate ideas, methods, and theories from other disciplines for Communication research. My absolute favorite is usingautoethnographyto make sense of my career as a full time Paramedic in East Texas (1997-2011) and find ways to improve mental health for EMS, police, and fire services. I have a touch of PTSD and depression...so don't expect me to answer emails 9-10 Wednesdays I have therapy. I love Dr Pepper and Little Debbie OatmealCremePies.I spend too much time playingon linegames, watching the TourdeFrance, and finding ways to avoid yard work I promised my wife I'd do 6 months ago. My superpower is Shins of Steel... I once took a Buick to the shin at 30 mph.Thanks to my good looks, quick wit, and Southern charm I have been married to Mrs Dr D since 1998 (happily married came when I left EMS in 2011).We have 5 children: Justin and Gypsie (both 22, newly-wed in August 2020), John (21, Senior at Indiana University), Bryan (9), Bryce (8), and Brionna (7) plus our fur babies Shiner the Dog, Steev our sophisticated cat, and our little Roxxie the abandoned roadside cat. I am an Eagle Scout (1989) and did mission service in Los Angeles in the early 1990s working primarily with the Samoan peoples. I might be an OG with Park Village Crips.
