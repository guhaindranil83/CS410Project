He specializes in polymer engineering and is working on multiple research projects that include polymer reactive extrusion, rubber devulcanization using supercritical carbon dioxide, plastics and rubber nanocomposites, inferential sensors for polymer compounding, and modification of polyolefins through reactive extrusion. Professor Tzoganakis and his research team successfully developed a reactive extrusion technology on the melt-phase hydrosilylation of polypropylene. This technology facilitates the modification of polypropylene for increased adhesion, chemical reactivity and hydrophilicity, and is beneficial to manufacturers of engineered plastics and elastomers. Milliken, a worldwide manufacturer of specialty additives, has recognized the market opportunity to incorporate this technology in their line of products, and was able to secure a license for the technology. Another significant contribution of Professor Tzoganakis is in the area of rubber devulcanization using supercritical carbon dioxide. His efforts have led to the development of a green technology that converts scrap tire rubber into a tire-derived polymer that can be used as a feed stock for new tire manufacturing, automotive seals and other elastomeric high value products. In addition to his teaching and research duties, Professor Tzoganakis serves as Chief Technology Officer of Tyromer Inc., a University of Waterloo start-up company that is working to commercialize a patented technology on rubber devulcanization. In recognition of his research contributions, Professor Tzoganakis has received the following prestigious awards: (i) Syncrude Canada Innovation Award from the Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering (CSChE) in 2000, (ii) Heinz List Award from the Extrusion Division of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) in 2015, (iii) Heinz Hermann Award from the Extrusion Division of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE) in 2018, and (iv) James L. White Innovation Award from the Polymer processing Society (PPS) in 2018. Professor Tzoganakis is a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Canada (CIC) and a Fellow of the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE).Research InterestsReactive Extrusion of PolymersExtrusion of Polymers with Supercritical CO2Devulcanization of Recycled Rubber with Supercritical Carbon DioxidePlastics and Rubber NanocompositesAnalysis and On-line Monitoring of Polymer Compounding OperationsPolymer RheologyMathematical Modeling and Numerical Simulation of Polymer Processing OperationsEducation1989, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, McMaster University1983, Dipl.
