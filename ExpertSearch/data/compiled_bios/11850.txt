Academic Press (Elsevier). doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-800723-5.00012-7More infoTo prevent the outbreaks of foodborne diseases, early detection of common pathogens is necessary, using field deployable biosensors. In this chapter, traditional laboratory-based assays are discussed: culture plating and colony counting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subsequent efforts in making these laboratory assays into field deployable biosensors are discussed, specifically using the lab-on-a-chip (LOC) platforms, paper microfluidics, as well as the use of smartphones.Harshman, D. K., & Yoon, J. (2016). Wire-Guided Droplet Manipulation for Molecular Biology. In Microfluidic Methods for Molecular Biology(pp 235-252). Springer. doi:10.1007/978-3-319-30019-1_12More infoWire-guided droplet manipulation (WDM) is a simple method of manipulating liquid droplets in a hydrophobic environment to conduct experiments, reactions, and assays. In WDM, a wire (or needle tip) manipulates microliter-sized liquid droplets within an immiscible liquid or on a hydrophobic surface. The attributes of this format for liquid handling address some of the challenges facing the use of conventional techniques. Specifically, WDM provides solutions for development of automated, sample-to-answer, point-of-care systems with potential applications in medicine, life science research, forensics, veterinary diagnostics, and disease control. The widespread applicability of this technique is due to its inherent simplicity, stemming from the attractive force between the droplet and the wire. The physics of this interaction will be explained in this chapter. WDM can be applied to standard protocols and is easily reprogrammable for different liquid handling applications. Dilution, mixing, centrifugation, and thermocycling have all be automated by WDM [1]. If desired, the principles of droplet manipulation can be easily integrated into the common scientific automation strategy, using commercially available robotic pipetting systems. WDM is automatable, reprogrammable, easy to use, and robust. These are essential features of rapid, all-in-one, sample-to-answer systems to be used at the point-of-care. The applications of WDM within molecular biology that have been demonstrated include DNA extraction (lysing, precipitation, washing and rehydration), nanoparticle surface deposition for fabrication of a protein nanoarray, immunoassay, PCR thermocycling, and real-time PCR.Liang, P., Park, T.

Microfluidic Point-of-care Ecarin Based Clotting and Chromogenic Assays for Monitoring Direct Thrombin Inhibitors. Journal of ExtraCorporeal Technology, 51, 29-37.More infoDirectthrombininhibitors(DTIs),suchasbivalirudin and dabigatran, have maintained steady inpatient and outpatientuseassubstitutesforheparinandwarfarin,respectively, because of their high bioavailability and relatively safe ontherapy range. Current clinical methods lack the capacity to directly quantify plasma DTI concentrations across wide ranges. At present, the gold standard is the ecarin clotting time (ECT), where ecarin maximizes thrombin activity and clotting time is evaluated to assess DTIs anticoagulation capability. This work focused on the development of a microuidic paper analytic device (uPAD) that can quantify the extent of anticoagulation as well as DTI concentration within a patients whole blood sample. Capillary action propels a small blood sample to ow through the nitrocellulose paper channels. Digital images of whole blood migration are then captured by our self-coded Raspberry Pi and/or the Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone camera. Both the ow length and the blue absorbance from the plasma front on the mPAD were measured, allowing simultaneous, dual assays: ecarin clotting test (ECT) and ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA). Statistically signicant (p < .05) changes in ow and absorbance were observed within our translational research study. Currently, there are no quantitative, commercially available point-of-care tests for the ECT and ECA within the United States. Both the ECT and ECA assays could be instrumental to differentiate between supratherapeutic and subtherapeutic incidents during bridging anticoagulanttherapyandlimittheunwarranteduseofreversal agents.Bills, M. V., Nguyen, B. T., & Yoon, J. (2019). Simplified White Blood Cell Differential: An Inexpensive, Smartphone- and Paper-Based Blood Cell Count. IEEE Sensors Journal, 19(18), 7822-7828. doi:https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2920235More infoSorting and measuring blood by cell type is extremely valuable clinically and provides physicians with key information for diagnosing many different disease states including: leukemia, autoimmune disorders, and bacterial infections. Despite the value, the present methods are unnecessarily costly and inhibitive particularly in resource poor settings, as they require multiple steps of reagent and/or dye additions and subsequent rinsing followed by manual counting using a hemocytometer, or they require a bulky, expensive equipment such as a flow cytometer. While direct on-paper imaging has been considered challenging, paper substrate offers a strong potential to simplify such reagent/dye addition and rinsing. In this paper, three-layer paper-based device is developed to automate such reagent/dye addition and rinsing via capillary action, and separating white blood cells (WBCs) from whole blood samples. Direct on-paper imaging is demonstrated using a commercial microscope attachment to a smartphone coupled with a blue LED and 500 nm long pass optical filter. Image analysis is accomplished using an original MATLAB code, to evaluate the total WBC count, and differential WBC count, i.e., granulocytes (primarily neutrophils) versus agranulocytes (primarily lymphocytes). Only a finger-prick of whole blood is required for this assay. The total assay time from finger-prick to data collection is under five minutes. Comparison with a hemocytometry-based manual counting corroborates the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. This approach could be potentially used to help make blood cell counting technologies more readily available, especially in resource poor and point-of-care settings.Chung, S., Breshears, L. E., Perea, S., Morrison, C. M., Betancourt, W. Q., Reynolds, K. A., & Yoon, J. (2019). Smartphone-Based Paper Microfluidic Particulometry of Norovirus from Environmental Water Samples at the Single Copy Level. ACS Omega, 4(6), 11180-11188. doi:https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b00772More infoHuman enteric viruses can be highly infectious and thus capable of causing disease upon ingestion of low doses ranging from 10^0 to 10^2 virions. Norovirus is a good example with a minimum infectious dose as low as a few tens of virions, that is, below femtogram scale. Norovirus detection from commonly implicated environmental matrices (water and food) involves complicated concentration of viruses and/or amplification of the norovirus genome, thus rendering detection approaches not feasible for field applications. In this work, norovirus detection was performed on a microfluidic paper analytic device without using any sample concentration or nucleic acid amplification steps by directly imaging and counting on-paper aggregation of antibody-conjugated, fluorescent submicron particles. An in-house developed smartphone-based fluorescence microscope and an image-processing algorithm isolated the particles aggregated by antibodyantigen binding, leading to an extremely low limit of norovirus detection, as low as 1 genome copy/L in deionized water and 10 genome copies/L in reclaimed wastewater.Chung, S., Jennings, C. M., & Yoon, J. (2019). Distance versus Capillary Flow DynamicsBased Detection Methods on a Microfluidic PaperBased Analytical Device (PAD). Chemistry - A European Journal, 25(57), 13070-13077. doi:https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201901514More infoIn recent years, there has been high interest in paperbased microfluidic sensors or microfluidic paperbased analytical devices (PADs) towards lowcost, portable, and easytouse sensing for chemical and biological targets. PAD allows spontaneous liquid flow without any external or internal pumping, as well as an innate filtration capability. Although both optical (colorimetric and fluorescent) and electrochemical detection have been demonstrated on PADs, several limitations still remain, such as the need for additional equipment, vulnerability to ambient lighting perturbation, and inferior sensitivity. Herein, alternative detection methods on PADs are reviewed to resolve these issues, including relatively well studied distancebased measurements and the newer capillary flow dynamicsbased method. Detection principles, assay performance, strengths, and weaknesses are explained for these methods, along with their potential future applications towards pointofcare medical diagnostics and other fieldbased applications.Kaarj, K., & Yoon, J. (2019). Methods of Delivering Mechanical Stimuli to Organ-on-a-Chip. Micromachines, 10(10), 700. doi:https://doi.org/10.3390/mi10100700More infoRecent advances in integrating microengineering and tissue engineering have enabled the creation of promising microengineered physiological models, known as organ-on-a-chip (OOC), for experimental medicine and pharmaceutical research. OOCs have been used to recapitulate the physiologically critical features of specific human tissues and organs and their interactions. Application of chemical and mechanical stimuli is critical for tissue development and behavior, and they were also applied to OOC systems. Mechanical stimuli applied to tissues and organs are quite complex in vivo, which have not adequately recapitulated in OOCs. Due to the recent advancement of microengineering, more complicated and physiologically relevant mechanical stimuli are being introduced to OOC systems, and this is the right time to assess the published literature on this topic, especially focusing on the technical details of device design and equipment used. We first discuss the different types of mechanical stimuli applied to OOC systems: shear flow, compression, and stretch/strain. This is followed by the examples of mechanical stimuli-incorporated OOC systems. Finally, we discuss the potential OOC systems where various types of mechanical stimuli can be applied to a single OOC device, as a better, physiologically relevant recapitulation model, towards studying and evaluating experimental medicine, human disease modeling, drug development, and toxicology.Klug, K. E., Jennings, C. M., Lytal, N., An, L., & Yoon, J. (2019). Mie Scattering and Microparticle-Based Characterization of Heavy Metal Ions and Classification by Statistical Inference Methods. Royal Society Open Science, 6(5), 190001. doi:https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.190001More infoA straightforward method for classifying heavy metal ions in water is proposed using statistical classification and clustering techniques from non-specific microparticle scattering data. A set of carboxylated polystyrene microparticles of sizes 0.91, 0.75 and 0.40 m was mixed with the solutions of nine heavy metal ions and two control cations, and scattering measurements were collected at two angles optimized for scattering from non-aggregated and aggregated particles. Classification of these observations was conducted and compared among several machine learning techniques, including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine analysis, K-means clustering and K-medians clustering. This study found the highest classification accuracy using the linear discriminant and support vector machine analysis, each reporting high classification rates for heavy metal ions with respect to the model. This may be attributed to moderate correlation between detection angle and particle size. These classification models provide reasonable discrimination between most ion species, with the highest distinction seen for Pb(II), Cd(II), Ni(II) and Co(II), followed by Fe(II) and Fe(III), potentially due to its known sorption with carboxyl groups. The support vector machine analysis was also applied to three different mixture solutions representing leaching from pipes and mine tailings, and showed good correlation with single-species data, specifically with Pb(II) and Ni(II). With more expansive training data and further processing, this method shows promise for low-cost and portable heavy metal identification and sensing.Lee, K., Park, H., Baek, S., Han, S., Kim, D., Chung, S., Yoon, J., & Seo, J. (2019). Colorimetric Array Freshness Indicator and Digital Color Processing for Monitoring the Freshness of Packaged Chicken Breast. Food Packaging and Shelf Life, 22, 100408. doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fpsl.2019.100408More infoA colorimetric array freshness indicator was developed to monitor chicken breast spoilage, consisting of an inner poly(ether-block-amide) (PEBA) film, a color-changing layer of eight polymer-immobilized pH dyes, and an outer poly(ethylene terephthalate) film. Simulated experiments with trimethyl amine (TMA) revealed the necessary color changes and the optimum dye concentration for the expected quality range for stored chicken breast was determined. The optimized colorimetric array freshness indicator was then applied to chicken breast packaging and digital images for its color response were acquired using a smartphone camera over storage time. The obtained data were analyzed by both the newly developed chromatic factor and principal component analysis. Chicken breast samples stored at 4C and 10C could be categorized into two groups, fresh and spoiled states over the storage time. The chromatic parameter X was well correlated with the microorganism counts as well as total volatile base nitrogen (TVBN) and CO2 from the chicken meat samples. Future implementation of the indicator in combination with a smartphone application could provide a low-cost, specific, and sensitive monitoring method for food product freshness.Sweeney, R. E., Nguyen, V., Alouidor, B., Budiman, E., Wong, R. K., & Yoon, J. (2019). Flow Rate and Raspberry Pi-based Paper Microfluidic Blood Coagulation Assay Device. IEEE Sensors Journal, 19(13), 4743-4751. doi:https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2902065More infoMonitoring blood coagulation in response to an anticoagulant (heparin) and its reversal agent (protamine) is essential during and after surgery, especially with cardiopulmonary bypass. A current clinical standard is the use of activated clotting time, where the mechanical movement of a plunger through a whole blood-filled channel is monitored to evaluate the endpoint time of coagulation. As a rapid, simple, low-volume, and cost-effective alternative, we have developed a paper microfluidic assay and Raspberry Pi-based device with the aim of quantifying the extent of blood coagulation in response to varying doses of heparin and protamine. The flow rate of blood through the paper microfluidic channel is automatically monitored using the Python-coded edge detection algorithm. For each set of the assay, 8-L of fresh human whole blood (untreated and undiluted) from human subjects is loaded onto each of eight sample pads, which have been preloaded with varying amounts of heparin or protamine. The total assay time is 3-5 min including the time for sample loading and incubation.Ulep, T., Day, A. S., Sosnowski, K., Shumaker, A., & Yoon, J. (2019). Interfacial Effect-Based Quantification of Droplet Isothermal Nucleic Acid Amplification for Bacterial Infection. Scientific Reports, 9, 9629. doi:https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-46028-8More infoBacterial infection is a widespread problem in humans that can potentially lead to hospitalization and morbidity. The largest obstacle for physicians/clinicians is the time delay in accurately identifying infectious bacteria, especially their sub-species, in order to adequately treat and diagnose such infected patients. Loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) is a nucleic acid amplification method that has been widely used in diagnostic applications due to its simplicity of constant temperature, use of up to 4 to 6 primers (rendering it highly specific), and capability of amplifying low copies of target sequences. Use of interfacial effect-based monitoring is expected to dramatically shorten the time-to-results of nucleic acid amplification techniques. In this work, we developed a LAMP-based point-of-care platform for detection of bacterial infection, utilizing smartphone measurement of contact angle from oil-immersed droplet LAMP reactions. Whole bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7) were assayed in buffer as well as 5% diluted human whole blood. Monitoring of droplet LAMP reactions was demonstrated in a three-compartment, isothermal proportional-integrated-derived (PID)-controlled chip. Smartphone-captured images of droplet LAMP reactions, and their contact angles, were evaluated. Contact angle decreased substantially upon target amplification in both buffer and whole blood samples. In comparison, no-target control (NTC) droplets remained stable throughout the 30min isothermal reactions. These results were explained by the pre-adsorption of plasma proteins to an oil-water interface (lowering contact angle), followed by time-dependent amplicon formation and their preferential adsorption to the plasma protein-occupied oil-water interface. Time-to-results was as fast as 5min, allowing physicians to quickly make their decision for infected patients. The developed assay demonstrated quantification of bacteria concentration, with a limit-of-detection at 10^2CFU/L for buffer samples, and binary target or no-target identification with a limit-of-detection at 10CFU/L for 5% diluted whole blood samples.Baynes, C., & Yoon, J. (2018). PAD Fluorescence Scattering Immunoagglutination Assay for Cancer Biomarkers from Blood and Serum. SLAS Technology, 23(1), 30-43. doi:10.1177/2472630317731891More infoA microfluidic paper analytical device (PAD) was created for the sensitive quantification of cancer antigens, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), from human whole blood and serum, toward diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer. Anti-CEA and antiCA 19-9 antibodies were covalently linked to submicron, fluorescent polystyrene particles, loaded, and then dried in the center of the PAD channel. CEA- or CA 19-9spiked blood or serum samples were loaded to the inlet of PAD, and subsequent immunoagglutination changed the fluorescent scatter signals upon ultraviolet (UV) excitation. The total assay time was about 1 min. Detection limits were 1 pg/mL for CEA and 0.1 U/mL for CA 19-9 from both 10% diluted blood and undiluted serum. The use of UV excitation and subsequent fluorescence scattering enabled much higher double-normalized intensities (up to 1.283.51, compared with 1.067 with the elastic Mie scatter detection), successful detection in the presence of blood or serum, and distinct multiplex assays with minimum cross-reaction of antibodies. The results with undiluted serum showed the larger dynamic range and smaller standard errors, which can be attributed to the presence of serum proteins, functioning as a stabilizer or a passivating protein for the particles within paper fibers.Chung, S., Breshears, L. E., & Yoon, J. (2018). Smartphone Near Infrared Monitoring of Plant Stress. Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, 154, 93-98. doi:10.1016/j.compag.2018.08.046More infoThe most widely used method for monitoring plant stress is the use of near infrared (NIR) spectrophotometry to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as defined by [NIR reflectancered reflectance]/[NIR reflectance+red reflectance]. NDVI measures the chlorophyll absorption in the red spectrum relative to the scattering by cellular structure in NIR, and has been used to monitor vegetation health and subsequently its stress from aerial or satellite images. Rather than using an NIR spectrophotometer or an NIR camera that is rather expensive, we attempted to use a commercial smartphone, utilizing its (potentially unintended) ability in recognizing near infrared (NIR) color. Some of the most recent versions of smartphones have eliminated the NIR block filters on their cameras, and able to recognize NIR in their red pixels of CMOS array. Through attaching an inexpensive high pass filter at 800nm to a smartphone camera, we were able to collect the NIR reflectance (with a high pass optical filter) and the red reflectance (without a filter), enabling NDVI assessments. This method was verified by measuring the NDVI values from a series of chlorophyll solutions, and showed a strong linear correlation with R^2=0.948, corroborating the smartphones ability in evaluating NDVI. Using the leaves from three different plant species, the NDVI values were evaluated using the smartphone and compared with the plants' chlorophyll contents using acetone extraction and subsequent spectrophotometry. A good linear relationship was found with R^2=0.88-0.92. We further evaluated the NDVI values against the plants water contents (measured by oven-drying), showing the non-linear relationship with the NDVI saturation above 50% water content. The assay time was almost instantaneous, requiring only a smartphone and a high pass filter, thus allowing inexpensive, easy-to-use, rapid, and early prediction of plant stress that can be used for field and household applications.Kaarj, K., Akarapipad, P., & Yoon, J. (2018). Simpler, Faster, and Sensitive Zika Virus Assay Using Smartphone Detection of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification on Paper Microfluidic Chips. Scientific Reports, 8(12438). doi:10.1038/s41598-018-30797-9More infoThe recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak has prompted the need for field-ready diagnostics that are rapid, easy-to-use, handheld, and disposable while providing extreme sensitivity and specificity. To meet this demand, we developed a wax-printed paper microfluidic chip utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). The developed simple and sensitive ZIKV assay was demonstrated using undiluted tap water, human urine, and diluted (10%) human blood plasma. Paper type, pore size, and channel dimension of various paper microfluidic chips were investigated and optimized to ensure proper filtration of direct-use biological samples (tap water, urine, and plasma) during capillary action-driven flow. Once ZIKV RNA has flowed and reached to a detection area of the paper microfluidic chip, it was excised for the addition of an RT-LAMP mixture with a pH indicator, then placed on a hot plate at 68 C. Visible color changes from successful amplification were observed in 15minutes and quantified by smartphone imaging. The limit of detection was as low as 1 copy/uL. The developed platform can also be used for identifying other flaviviruses, such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Dengue virus (DENV), and potentially other quickly transmitted virus pathogens, towards field-based diagnostics.Klug, K. E., Reynolds, K. A., & Yoon, J. (2018). A Capillary Flow Dynamics-Based Sensing Modality for Direct Environmental Pathogen Monitoring. Chemistry - A European Journal, 24(23), 6025-6029. doi:10.1002/chem.201800085More infoToward ultrasimple and fieldready biosensors, we demonstrate a novel assay transducer mechanism based on interfacial property changes and capillary flow dynamics in antibodyconjugated submicron particle suspensions. Differential capillary flow is tunable, allowing pathogen quantification as a function of flow rate through a paperbased microfluidic device. Flow models based on interfacial and rheological properties indicate a significant relationship between the flow rate and the interfacial effects caused by targetparticle aggregation. This mechanism is demonstrated for assays of Escherichia coli K12 in water samples and Zika virus (ZIKV) in blood serum. These assays achieved very low limits of detection compared with other demonstrated methods (1log CFU/mL E. coli and 20pg/mL ZIKV whole virus) with an operating time of 30s, showing promise for environmental and health monitoring.Ulep, T., & Yoon, J. (2018). Challenges in Paper-Based Fluorogenic Optical Sensing with Smartphones. Nano Convergence, 5(14). doi:10.1186/s40580-018-0146-1More infoApplication of optically superior, tunable fluorescent nanotechnologies have long been demonstrated throughout many chemical and biological sensing applications. Combined with microfluidics technologies, i.e. on lab-on-a-chip platforms, such fluorescent nanotechnologies have often enabled extreme sensitivity, sometimes down to single molecule level. Within recent years there has been a peak interest in translating fluorescent nanotechnology onto paper-based platforms for chemical and biological sensing, as a simple, low-cost, disposable alternative to conventional silicone-based microfluidic substrates. On the other hand, smartphone integration as an optical detection system as well as user interface and data processing component has been widely attempted, serving as a gateway to on-board quantitative processing, enhanced mobility, and interconnectivity with informational networks. Smartphone sensing can be integrated to these paper-based fluorogenic assays towards demonstrating extreme sensitivity as well as ease-of-use and low-cost. However, with these emerging technologies there are always technical limitations that must be addressed; for example, papers autofluorescence that perturbs fluorogenic sensing; smartphone flashs limitations in fluorescent excitation; smartphone cameras limitations in detecting narrow-band fluorescent emission, etc. In this review, physical optical setups, digital enhancement algorithms, and various fluorescent measurement techniques are discussed and pinpointed as areas of opportunities to further improve paper-based fluorogenic optical sensing with smartphones.Cho, S., & Yoon, J. (2017). Organ-on-a-Chip for Assessing Environmental Toxicants. Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 45, 34-42. doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2016.11.019More infoMan-made xenobiotics, whose potential toxicological effects are not fully understood, are oversaturating the already-contaminated environment. Due to the rate of toxicant accumulation, unmanaged disposal, and unknown adverse effects to the environment and the human population, there is a crucial need to screen for environmental toxicants. Animal models and in vitro models are ineffective models in predicting in vivo responses due to inter-species difference and/or lack of physiologically-relevant 3D tissue environment. Such conventional screening assays possess limitations that prevent dynamic understanding of toxicants and their metabolites produced in the human body. Organ-on-a-chip systems can recapitulate in vivo like environment and subsequently in vivo like responses generating a realistic mock-up of human organs of interest, which can potentially provide human physiology-relevant models for studying environmental toxicology. Feasibility, tunability, and low-maintenance features of organ-on-chips can also make possible to construct an interconnected network of multiple-organs-on-chip towards a realistic human-on-a-chip system. Such interconnected organ-on-a-chip network can be efficiently utilized for toxicological studies by enabling the study of metabolism, collective response, and fate of toxicants through its journey in the human body. Further advancements can address the challenges of this technology, which potentiates high predictive power for environmental toxicology studies.Cho, S., Park, T. S., Reynolds, K. A., & Yoon, J. (2017). Multi-Normalization and Interpolation Protocol to Improve Norovirus Immunoagglutination Assay from Paper Microfluidics with Smartphone Detection. SLAS Technology, 22(6), 609-615. doi:10.1177/2472630317724769More infoNorovirus (NoV) is one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis, affecting 685 million people per year around the world. The best preventive measure is to screen water for possible NoV contamination, not from infected humans, preferably using rapid and field-deployable diagnostic methods. While enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) can be used for such detection, the low infectious dose as well as the generally inferior sensitivity and low titer of available NoV antibodies render critical challenges in using EIAs toward NoV detection. In this work, we demonstrated smartphone-based Mie scatter detection of NoV with immunoagglutinated latex particles on paper microfluidic chips. Using only three different concentrations of anti-NoV-conjugated particles, we were able to construct a single standard curve that covered seven orders of magnitude of NoV antigen concentrations. Multiple normalization steps and interpolation procedures were developed to estimate the optimum amount of antibody-conjugated particles that matched to the target NoV concentration. A very low detection limit of 10 pg/mL was achieved without using any concentration or enrichment steps. This method can also be adapted for detection of any other virus pathogens whose antibodies possess low sensitivity and low antibody titer.McCracken, K. E., Tat, T., Paz, V., & Yoon, J. (2017). Smartphone-Based Fluorescence Detection of Bisphenol A from Water Samples. RSC Advances, 7(15), 9237-9243. doi:10.1039/C6RA27726HMore infoBisphenol A (BPA), an emerging environmental contaminant and endocrine disrupting compound, has been observed globally in surface waters and waste leachates at concentrations that are hazardous to aquatic life and potentially to humans. Limitations in field monitoring on account of the extensive laboratory infrastructure required for standard BPA detection warrants investigation into portable or handheld sensing platforms. In this work, we evaluated a standalone smartphone-based fluorescence sensing method for identifying BPA from water samples. Toward this goal, we demonstrated the novel application of 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS) as a fluorescent probe with suitable specificity to BPA compared to functionally and structurally similar hormone and endocrine disrupting compounds. Using this method, bisphenol A was quantifiable through both standard fluorescence spectroscopy and smartphone detection, with an empirical binding constant of K_SV = 2040 M^-1 and a direct, unfiltered detection limit of 4.4 M from unprocessed samples, suitable for waste leachate and industrial samples. Implementation of further digital image processing and smartphone spectroscopy methods may help to lower this detection limit, bearing promise for future direct detection of bisphenol A from wastewater leachate and environmental samples via smartphones.Nicolini, A.

Journal of Biological Engineering, 11, 7. doi:10.1186/s13036-016-0046-zMore infoSince early reports of the ongoing Zika virus outbreak in May 2015, much has been learned and discussed regarding Zika virus infection and transmission. However, many opportunities still remain for translating these findings into field-ready sensors and diagnostics. In this brief review, we discuss current diagnostic methods, consider the prospects of translating other flavivirus biosensors directly to Zika virus sensing, and look toward the future developments needed for high-sensitivity and high-specificity biosensors to come.Nicolini, A.

Advanced Biosystems, 1(10), 1700098. doi:10.1002/adbi.201700098More infoThis work demonstrates for the first time rapid, real-time Mie scatter sensing of colloidal emulsion nucleic acid amplification directly from emulsion droplets. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification is used in this study, and, to our knowledge, has not previously been used in a colloidal emulsion platform. Interfacial tension values () associated with bulk protein adsorption and denaturation at the oilwater interface exhibit characteristic changes in the absence or presence of amplification. In the presence of target and amplicon, emulsions maintain a constant 300400 nm diameter, whereas emulsions formed with no target control show a rapid decrease in droplet diameter to Park, T.

SLAS Technology, 22(1), 7-12. doi:10.1177/2211068216639566More infoUse of a smartphone as an optical detector for paper microfluidic devices has recently gained substantial attention due to its simplicity, ease-of-use, and handheld capability. Utilization of a UV light source enhances the optical signal intensities, especially for the particle immunoagglutination assay that has typically utilized visible or ambient light. Such enhancement is essential for true assimilation of assays to field deployable and point-of-care applications by greatly reducing the effects by independent environmental factors. This work is the first demonstration of utilizing a UV LED (UVA) to enhance the Mie scatter signals from the particle immunoagglutination assay on the paper microfluidic devices, and subsequent smartphone detection. Smartphones CMOS camera can recognize the UVA scatter from the paper microfluidic channels efficiently in its green channel. For Escherichia coli assay, the normalized signal intensities increased up to 50% from the negative signal with UV LED, compared to the 4-7% with ambient light. Detection limit was 10 CFU/mL. Similar results were obtained in the presence of 10% human whole blood.Sweeney, R. E., & Yoon, J. (2017). Angular Photodiode Array-Based Device to Detect Bacterial Pathogens in a Wound Model. IEEE Sensors Journal, 17(21), 6911-6917. doi:10.1109/JSEN.2017.2752155More infoWe have developed a device that is able to rapidly and specifically diagnose bacterial pathogens in a wound model based on Mie scatter spectra from a tissue surface. The Mie scatter spectra collected is defined as the intensity of Mie scatter over the angle of detection from a tissue surface. A 650-nm LED perpendicular to the surface illuminates a tissue sample (90) and photodiodes positioned in 10 increments from 10 to 80 of backscatter act as the detectors to collect these Mie scatter spectra. Through principal component analysis of the Mie scatter spectra collected, we have shown significant differences between Mie scatter spectra of tissues with bacterial pathogens versus those without, as well as significant differences between each species of bacteria tested. The device developed has been tested with a porcine dermis wound model, with samples inoculated with one of three bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella Typhimurium). Such a device could be critical in the monitoring of a wound for infection and rapid, specific diagnosis of a bacterial wound infection, which would significantly reduce the time and cost associated with specific diagnosis of a bacterial wound infection currently.Sweeney, R. E., Budiman, E., & Yoon, J. (2017). Mie Scatter Spectra-Based Device for Instant, Contact-Free, and Specific Diagnosis of Bacterial Skin Infection. Scientific Reports, 7, 4801. doi:10.1038/s41598-017-05061-1More infoRapid and specific diagnostic techniques are needed to expedite specific treatment of bacterial skin infections with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, rather than broad-spectrum. Through this work a device was developed to determine the presence of and species responsible for a bacterial skin infection using differences in Mie scatter spectra created by different bacterial species. A 650nm LED at five different incident angles is used to illuminate the tissue, with Mie scatter being detected by PIN photodiodes at eight different detection angles. Mie scatter patterns are collected at all photodiode angles for each of the incident light angles, resulting in a Mie scatter spectra. Detectable differences in Mie scatter spectra were found using the device developed between commensal bacteria (no infection) and bacteria inoculated (infection) on the surface of both porcine and human cadaveric epidermis. Detectable differences were found between species of infection, specifically Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with differences summarized through principle component analysis. Mie scatter spectra can be detected within a few seconds without skin contact. This device is the first to rapidly and specifically diagnose bacterial skin infections in a contact-less manner, allowing for initial treatment with narrow spectrum antibiotics, and helping to reduce the likelihood of resistance.Yoon, J.

Journal of Biological Engineering, 11, 3. doi:10.1186/s13036-016-0038-zMore infoOctober 10th, 2016 marked the 9th anniversary for the Journal of Biological Engineering (JBE), the official journal of Institute of Biological Engineering (IBE), published by BioMed Central. We are entering into the 10th year of its exciting and productive history. In this editorial, a brief history of JBE is summarized, along with a series of analyses on average number of citations, breakdown of topical subjects, geographical representations and so forth for all published articles in JBE. Future prospects and new directions of JBE are also described in this editorial.Cho, S., Islas-Robles, A., Nicolini, A. M., Monks, T. J., & Yoon, J. (2016). In Situ, Dual-Mode Monitoring of Organ-on-a-Chip with Smartphone-Based Fluorescence Microscope. Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 86, 697-705. doi:10.1016/j.bios.2016.07.015More infoThe use of organ-on-a-chip (OOC) platforms enables improved simulation of the human kidneys response to nephrotoxic drugs. The standard method of analyzing nephrotoxicity from existing OOC has majorly consisted of invasively collecting samples (cells, lysates, media, etc.) from OOC. Such disruptive analyses potentiate contamination, disrupt the replicated in vivo environment, and require expertise to execute. Moreover, traditional analyses, including immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblot, and microplate immunoassay are essentially not in situ and require substantial time, resources, and cost. In the present work, the incorporation of fluorescence nanoparticle immunocapture/immunoagglutination assay into an OOC enabled dual-mode monitoring of drug-induced nephrotoxicity in situ. A smartphone-based fluorescence microscope was fabricated as a handheld in situ monitoring device attached to an OOC. Both the presence of -glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) on the apical brush-border membrane of 786-O proximal tubule cells within the OOC surface, and the release of GGT to the outflow of the OOC were evaluated with the fluorescence scatter detection of captured and immunoagglutinated anti-GGT conjugated nanoparticles. This dual-mode assay method provides a novel groundbreaking tool to enable the internal and external in situ monitoring of the OOC, which may be integrated into any existing OOCs to facilitate their subsequent analyses.McCracken, K. E., & Yoon, J. (2016). Recent Approaches for Optical Smartphone Sensing in Resource-Limited Settings: A Brief Review. Analytical Methods, 8, 6591-6601. doi:10.1039/C6AY01575AMore infoDevelopments in the emerging fields of smartphone chemical and biosensing have dovetailed with increased interest in environmental and health monitoring for resource-limited environments, culminating in research toward field-ready smartphone sensors. Optical sensors have received particular focus, in which smartphone imaging and on-board analysis have been integrated into both existing and novel colorimetric, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, spectroscopy-based, and scattering-based assays. Research in recent years has shown promising progress, but substantial limitations still exist due to environmental lighting interference, reliance upon proprietary smartphone attachments, and the undefined sensitivity variations between different smartphones. In this review, recent research in smartphone chemical and biosensing is assessed, and discussion is made regarding the opportunities that new research methods have to improve the scope resource-limited sensing.McCracken, K. E., Angus, S. V., Reynolds, K. A., & Yoon, J. (2016). Multimodal Imaging and Lighting Bias Correction for Improved uPAD-based Water Quality Monitoring via Smartphones. Scientific Reports, 6(27529). doi:10.1038/srep27529More infoSmartphone image-based sensing of microfluidic paper analytical devices (PADs) offers low-cost and mobile evaluation of water quality. However, consistent quantification is a challenge due to variable environmental, paper, and lighting conditions, especially across large multi-target PADs. Compensations must be made for variations between images to achieve reproducible results without a separate lighting enclosure. We thus developed a simple method using triple-reference point normalization and a fast-Fourier transform (FFT)-based pre-processing scheme to quantify consistent reflected light intensity signals under variable lighting and channel conditions. This technique was evaluated using various angles/heights of light source, imaging backgrounds, and type/quality of light source. Further testing evaluated its handle of absorbance, quenching, and relative scattering intensity measurements from assays detecting four water contaminants Cr(VI), total chlorine, caffeine, and E. coli K12 at similar wavelengths using the green channel of RGB images. Between assays, this algorithm reduced error from PAD surface inconsistencies and cross-image lighting gradients. Although the algorithm could not completely remove the anomalies arising from point shadows within channels or some non-uniform background reflections, it still afforded order-of-magnitude quantification and stable assay specificity under these conditions, offering one route toward improving smartphone quantification of PAD assays for in-field water quality monitoring.Nicolini, A. M., Toth, T. D., & Yoon, J. (2016). Tuneable Nanoparticle-Nanofiber Composite Substrate for Improved Cellular Adhesion. Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 145, 830-838. doi:10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.05.079More infoThis work presents a novel technique using a reverse potential electrospinning mode for fabricating nanoparticle-embedded composites that can be tailored to represent various fiber diameters, surface morphologies, and functional groups necessary for improved cellular adhesion. Polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers were electrospun in both traditional positive (PP) and reverse potential (RP) electrical fields. The fibers were incorporated with 300 nm polystyrene (PS) fluorescent particles, which contained carboxyl, amine groups, and surfactants. In the unconventional RP, the charged colloidal particles and surfactants were shown to have an exaggerated effect on Taylor cone morphology and fiber diameter caused by the changes in charge density and surface tension of the bulk solution. The RP mode was shown to lead to a decrease in fiber diameter from 1200 100 nm (diameter SE) for the nanofibers made with PCL alone to 440 80 nm with the incorporation of colloidal particles, compared to the PP mode ranging from 530 90 nm to 350 50 nm, respectively. The nanoparticle-nanofiber composite substrates were cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and evaluated for cellular viability and adhesion for up to 5 days. Adhesion to the nanofibrous substrates was improved by 180 10% with the addition of carboxylated particles and by 480 60% with the functionalization of an RGD ligand compared to the PCL nanofibers. The novel approach of electrospinning in the RP mode with the addition of colloids in order to alter charge density and surface tension could be utilized towards many applications, one being implantable biomaterials and tissue engineered scaffolds as demonstrated in this work.Angus, S. V., Cho, S., Harshman, D. K., Song, J., & Yoon, J. (2015). A Portable, Shock-Proof, Surface-Heated Droplet PCR System for Escherichia coli Detection. Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 74, 360-368. doi:10.1016/j.bios.2015.06.026More infoA novel quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) device was developed based on wire-guided droplet manipulation (WDM) method, where the droplet is guided to move over three different heating chambers, and subsequent real-time quantification utilizing a smartphone. The device was initially tested to amplify GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene and further tested to identify 16S rRNA gene (V3 hypervariable region) from Escherichia coli. The lower limit of detection was 10^3 CFU (colony forming units) or genome copies per sample. The device is portable with real-time quantification and provides the assay results quickly (30-cycle amplification for 15 min) and accurately. The system is also shock and vibration resistant, due to the multiple points of contact using the thermocouple to guide the droplet and the Teflon film on the heater surfaces. The thermocouple is also used to provide real-time temperature feedback on the droplet to ensure it reaches the set temperature before moving to the next chamber/step in PCR. The device is equipped to use either silicone oil or coconut oil, while the latter provides additional portability (without spilling and easier transportation) with its high melting temperature (solid at room temperature).Cho, S., Park, T. S., Nahapetian, T. G., & Yoon, J. (2015). Smartphone-based, sensitive uPAD detection of urinary tract infection and gonorrhea. Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 74, 601-611. doi:10.1016/j.bios.2015.07.014More infoThe presence of bacteria in urine can be used to monitor the onset or prognosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) and some sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs), such as gonorrhea. Typically, bacterias presence in urine is confirmed by culturing samples overnight on agar plates, followed by a microscopic examination. Additionally, the presence of E. coli in a urine sample can be indirectly confirmed through assaying for nitrite (generated by reducing nitrate in urine), however this is not sufficiently specific and sensitive. Species/strains identification of bacteria in a urine sample provides insight to appropriate antibiotic treatment options. In this work, a microfluidic paper analytic device (uPAD) was designed and fabricated for evaluating UTI (Escherichia coli) and STD (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) from human urine samples. Anti-E. coli or anti-N. gonorrhoeae antibodies were conjugated to submicron particles then pre-loaded and dried in the center of each paper microfluidic channel. Human urine samples (undiluted) spiked with E. coli or N. gonorrhoeae were incubated for 5 minutes with 1% Tween 80. The bacteria-spiked urine samples were then introduced to the inlet of paper microfluidic channel, which flowed through the channel by capillary force. Data confirms proteins were not filtered by uPAD, which is essential for this assay. Urobilin, the component responsible for the yellow appearance of urine and green fluorescence emission, was filtered by uPAD, resulting in significantly minimized false-positive signals. This filtration was simultaneously made during the uPAD assay and no pretreatment/purification step was necessary. Antibody-conjugated particles were immunoagglutinated at the center of the paper channel. The extent of immunoagglutination was quantified by angle-specific Mie scatter under ambient lighting conditions, utilizing a smartphone camera as a detector. The total uPAD assay time was less than 30 seconds. The detection limit was 10 CFU/mL for both E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae, while commercially available gonorrhea rapid kit showed a detection limit of 10^6 CFU/mL. A commercially available nitrite assay test strip also had a detection limit of 10^6 CFU/mL, but this method is not antibody-based and thus not sufficiently specific. By optimizing the particle concentration, we were also able to extend the linear range of the assay up to 10^7 CFU/mL. The proposed prototype will serve as a low-cost, point-of-care, sensitive urinalysis biosensor to monitor UTI and gonorrhea from human urine.Fronczek, C. F., & Yoon, J. (2015). Biosensors for Monitoring Airborne Pathogens. Journal of Laboratory Automation, 20(4), 309-410. doi:10.1177/2211068215580935More infoAirborne pathogens affect both humans and animals and are often highly and rapidly transmittable. Many problematic airborne pathogens, namely viral (influenza A/H1N1, rubella, and avian influenza/H5N1) and bacterial (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacillus anthracis) have huge impacts on healthcare and agricultural applications and can potentially be used as bio-terrorism agents. Many different laboratory-based methods have been introduced and are currently being used. However, such detection is generally limited by sample collection, including nasal swabs and blood analysis. Direct identification from air (specifically aerosol samples) would be ideal, but such detection has not been very successful due to the difficulty in sample collection and the extremely low pathogen concentration found in aerosol samples. In this review, we will discuss the portable biosensors and/or micro total analysis system (TAS) that can be used for monitoring such airborne pathogens, similar to smoke detectors. Current laboratory-based methods will be reviewed and the possible solutions to convert these lab-based methods into TAS biosensor will be discussed.Harshman, D. K., Rao, B. M., Mclain, J. E., Watts, G. S., & Yoon, J. (2015). Interfacial effects revolutionize qPCR by low threshold cycle detection and inhibition relief. Science Advances, 1(8), e1400061. doi:10.1126/sciadv.1400061More infoMolecular diagnostics offer quick access to information but fail to operate at speeds required for clinical decision-making. Our novel methodology for droplet on thermocouple silhouette real-time PCR (DOTS qPCR) utilizes interfacial effects to achieve droplet actuation, inhibition relief and sensing, for a sample-to-answer time as short as 5 min. Towards diagnosis of infective endocarditis we demonstrate reproducibility, differentiation of antibiotic susceptibility, sub-picogram limit of detection, and thermocycling speeds of 28 s/cycle in the presence of tissue contaminants. Langmuir and Gibbs adsorption isotherms are used to describe interfacial tension decrease upon amplification, and a log-linear relationship is presented for real-time quantification at the fifth thermocycle, by imaging the droplet silhouette with a smartphone. Commercially available real-time PCR systems that rely on fluorescent detection have substantially higher threshold cycles and require expensive optical components and extensive sample preparation. Our work is the first demonstrated use of interfacial effects for sensing of reaction progress and will enable molecular diagnosis of infection at the point-of-care.Liang, P., Nicolini, A. M., Ogden, K. L., & Yoon, J. (2015). Use of biosensors in secondary education classroom. Transactions of the ASABE, 58(2), 181-190. doi:10.13031/trans.58.10631More infoThe multidisciplinary and multi-application character of a biosensor makes it a very attractive topic to introduce science and engineering concepts into a secondary education classroom. Some of the techniques used in biosensors are easy to demonstrate and can be intriguing to students. We evaluated which application areas and techniques were more intriguing to the students through a survey, and developed a 60-90-min introductory lesson plan with hands-on experience. The survey was conducted to determine students greatest interest and motivation among four biosensor applications- medical diagnostics, food safety, biosecurity, and environmental monitoring- as well as seven techniques used in biosensors: genetic engineering, nanotechnology, circuit building, microfabrication, 3D printing, smartphone utilization, and computer programming. For the application areas, the middle school students showed the most interest in food safety, followed by environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics. The high school students showed the most interest in medical diagnostics. For the techniques used in biosensors, the middle school students showed the most interest in 3D printing, followed by circuit building and smartphone utilization, while the high school students showed the most interests in genetic engineering and nanotechnology. To capture the most interest early in the students education, we have designed a 60-90-min lesson plan for middle school students utilizing the application areas of food safety and environmental monitoring, as well as the techniques of 3D printing, circuit building, and smartphone utilization. Simplified sampling protocols are introduced for monitoring E. coli from lettuce, Salmonella from chicken packaging, and influenza A from aerosols. As an example of a biosensor, a commercial glucose assay kit is demonstrated using a simple photometric circuit (including an LED and a photodiode) as an optical transducer. As a second example, a commercial pregnancy test strip is demonstrated using a smartphone camera as an optical transducer. Finally, a plastic attachment to a smartphone, made with a 3D printer, is demonstrated to improve the sensitivity and reproducibility of the same pregnancy test. This lesson was carried out in a classroom, and the results exemplify the potential benefit of using biosensor research in a middle school classroom as well as the possibility of inspiring the students towards science and engineering fields of study or careers.Nicolini, A. M., Fronczek, C. F., & Yoon, J. (2015). Droplet-Based Immunoassay on a 'Sticky' Nanofibrous Surface for Multiplexed and Double Detection of Bacteria Using Smartphones. Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 67, 560-569.More infoWe have developed a rapid, sensitive, and specific droplet-based immunoassay for the detection of E. coli and Salmonella within a single-pipetted sample. Polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun fibers on indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass provide a sufficient surface to render a non-slip droplet condition, and while the PCL fibers lend a local hydrophilicity (contact angle theta = 74 deg) for sufficient sub-micron particle adhesion, air pockets within the fibers lend an apparent hydrophobicity. Overall, the contact angle of water on this electrospun surface is 119 deg, and the air pockets cause the droplet to be completely immobile and resistant to movement, protecting it from external vibration. By using both anti-E. coli conjugated, 510 nm diameter green fluorescent particles (480 nm excitation and 520 nm emission) and anti-Salmonella conjugated, 400 nm diameter red fluorescent particles (640 nm excitation and 690 nm emission), we can detect multiple targets in a single droplet. Using appropriate light sources guided by fiber optics, we determined a detection limit of 10^2 CFU/mL. Immunoagglutination can be observed under a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence detection (at the emission wavelength) of immunoagglutination was maximum at 90 degrees from the incident light, while light scattering (at the excitation wavelength) was still present and behaved similarly, indicating the ability of double detection, greatly improving credibility and reproducibility of the assay. A power function (light intensity) simulation of elastic Mie scatter confirmed that both fluorescence and light scattering were present. Due to the size of the fluorescent particles relative to their incident excitation wavelengths, Mie scatter conditions were observed, and fluorescence signals show a similar trend to light scattering signals. Smartphone detection was included for true portable detection, in which the high contact angle pinning of the droplet makes this format re-usable and re-configurable.Park, T. S., & Yoon, J. (2015). Smartphone Detection of Escherichia coli from Field Water Samples on Paper Microfluidics. IEEE Sensors Journal, 15(3), 1902-1907.More infoSmartphone detection of Escherichia coli from field water samples is successfully demonstrated using paper microfluidics. A three-channel paper chip is designed and fabricated, with a negative control channel pre-loaded with bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated beads and two E. coli detection channels pre-loaded with anti-E. coli conjugated beads, for low and high concentration detection. Field water samples are introduced to the paper chip by dipping or pipetting, and the antigens from E. coli travel through the paper fibers by capillary action while the dust/soil or algae particles are effectively filtered. Antibody-conjugated beads, confined within the paper fibers, immunoagglutinate in the presence of E. coli antigens, while BSA-conjugated beads do not. The extent of immunoagglutination is quantified by evaluating Mie scatter intensity from the digital images taken at an optimized angle and distance using a smartphone. The assay results show excellent agreement with the MacConkey plate results, i.e. the count of viable E. coli. The scatter simulation procedure is introduced to substitute for experimental optimization, such that the proposed method can be easily adapted to the other types of samples. A smartphone application is developed, incorporating the internal gyroscope of a smartphone, to allow the user to position the smartphone at an optimized angle of scatter detection. The detection limit is single-cell-level and the total assay time is 90 seconds.Fronczek, C. F., Park, T. S., Harshman, D. K., Nicolini, A. M., & Yoon, J. (2014). Paper microfluidic extraction and direct smartphone-based identification of pathogenic nucleic acids from field and clinical samples. RSC Advances, 4(22), 11103-11110.More infoAbstract: A rapid, paper microfluidic- and smartphone-based protocol was developed for the extraction and direct fluorescent identification of the nucleic acids of Salmonella Typhimurium from field and clinical samples. Initially, liquid samples (10% diluted) from fresh poultry packaging were loaded on the paper chips and were lysed with Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer. Nucleic acids from the lysed samples were eluted through the paper channel with TE buffer and the paper channel was excised into three pieces for the further polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The extraction efficiency was determined by measuring fluorescence reflectance with either a benchtop optical detection system (consisting of an LED light source, a pair of optical fibers, and a miniature spectrophotometer, all built on micro-positioning stages) or a smartphone-based fluorescent microscope (in-house fabricated). The limit of detection of Salmonella Typhimurium in 10% poultry packaging liquid with cellulose paper was 10 3 CFU mL-1, while that extracted with nitrocellulose paper was 104 CFU mL-1 (as determined by both PCR and fluorescence reflectance). Cellulose channels proved more appropriate for measuring low and very high concentrations of pathogen DNA, while nitrocellulose proved better for analysing the mid-range concentrations. We observed that DNA migrated through nitrocellulose at a faster rate and further than through cellulose due to charge-charge repulsion between nitrocellulose and DNA (both negatively charged), thus contributing to consistent and efficient extraction. We tested the efficiency of Salmonella extraction from 10% poultry packaging liquid, 10% whole blood, and 10% fecal samples, and obtained comparable extraction efficiency, as confirmed by smartphone-based direct fluorescent detection. This protocol is suitable for the direct detection of total bacteria count in a dirty sample (when specificity is not necessary) as well as determining extraction efficiency. This protocol is compatible with PCR, to provide specific information about the type of pathogen present in sample. 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Harshman, D. K., Reyes, R., Park, T. S., You, D. J., Song, J., & Yoon, J. (2014). Enhanced nucleic acid amplification with blood in situ by wire-guided droplet manipulation (WDM). Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 53, 167-174.More infoPMID: 24140832;PMCID: PMC3868462;Abstract: There are many challenges facing the use of molecular biology to provide pertinent information in a timely, cost effective manner. Wire-guided droplet manipulation (WDM) is an emerging format for conducting molecular biology with unique characteristics to address these challenges. To demonstrate the use of WDM, an apparatus was designed and assembled to automate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on a reprogrammable platform. WDM minimizes thermal resistance by convective heat transfer to a constantly moving droplet in direct contact with heated silicone oil. PCR amplification of the GAPDH gene was demonstrated at a speed of 8.67s/cycle. Conventional PCR was shown to be inhibited by the presence of blood. WDM PCR utilizes molecular partitioning of nucleic acids and other PCR reagents from blood components, within the water-in-oil droplet, to increase PCR reaction efficiency with blood in situ. The ability to amplify nucleic acids in the presence of blood simplifies pre-treatment protocols towards true point-of-care diagnostic use. The 16s rRNA hypervariable regions V3 and V6 were amplified from Klebsiella pneumoniae genomic DNA with blood in situ. The detection limit of WDM PCR was 1ng/L or 105genomes/L with blood in situ. The application of WDM for rapid, automated detection of bacterial DNA from whole blood may have an enormous impact on the clinical diagnosis of infections in bloodstream or chronic wound/ulcer, and patient safety and morbidity. 2013 Elsevier B.V.Kwon, H., Fronczek, C.

Journal of Laboratory Automation, 19(3), 322-331.More infoInfluenza A H1N1/2009 is a highly infectious, rapidly spreading airborne disease that needs to be monitored in near real time, preferably in a microfluidic format. However, such demonstration is difficult to find as H1N1 concentration in aerosol samples is extremely low, with interference from dust particles. In this work, we measured Mie scatter intensities from a microfluidic device with optical waveguide channels, where the antibody-conjugated latex beads immunoagglutinated with the target H1N1 antigens. Through careful optimizations of optical parameters, we were able to maximize the Mie scatter increase from the latex immunoagglutinations while minimizing the background scatter from the dust particles. The aerosol samples were collected from a 1:10 mock classroom using a button air sampler, where a nebulizer generated aerosols, simulating human coughing. The detection limits with real aerosol samples were 1 and 10 pg/mL, using a spectrometer or a cell phone camera as an optical detector, respectively. These are several orders of magnitudes more sensitive than the other methods. The microfluidic immunosensor readings are in concordance with the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The assay time was 30 s for sampling and 5 min for the microfluidic assay.Liang, P., Park, T. S., & Yoon, J. (2014). Rapid and Reagentless Detection of Microbial Contamination within Meat Utilizing a Smartphone-Based Biosensor. Scientific Reports, 4(5953).More infoA smartphone-utilized biosensor was developed for detecting microbial spoilage on ground beef, without using antibodies, microbeads or any other reagents, towards a preliminary screening tool for microbial contamination on meat products, and potentially towards wound infection. Escherichia coli K12 solutions (10^1 - 10^8 CFU/mL) were added to ground beef products to simulate microbial spoilage. An 880 nm near infrared LED was irradiated perpendicular to the surface of ground beef, and the scatter signals at various angles were evaluated utilizing the gyro sensor and the digital camera of a smartphone. The angle that maximized the Mie scatter varied by the E. coli concentration: 15 deg for 10^8 CFU/mL, 30 deg for 10^4 CFU/mL, and 45 deg for 10 CFU/mL, etc. SEM and fluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that the antigens and cell fragments from E. coli bonded preferably to the fat particles within meat, and the size and morphologies of such aggregates varied by the E. coli concentration.Park, T. S., Baynes, C., Cho, S., & Yoon, J. (2014). Paper Microfluidics for Red Wine Tasting. RSC Advances, 4(46), 24356-24362.More infoA paper microfluidic chip was designed and fabricated to evaluate the taste of 4 different red wines using a set of chemical dyes. The digital camera of a smartphone captured the images, and its red-green-blue (RGB) pixel intensities were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). Using 8 dyes and 2 principal components (PCs), we were able to distinguish each wine by the grape variety and the oxidation status. Through comparing with the flavor map by human evaluations, PC1 seemed to represent the sweetness and PC2 the dryness of red wine. This superior performance is attributed to: 1) careful selection of commercially available dyes through a series of linear correlation study with the taste chemicals in red wines, 2) minimization of sample-to-sample variation by splitting a single sample into multiple wells on the paper microfluidics, and 3) filtration of particulate matter through paper fibers. The image processing and PCA procedure can eventually be implemented as a stand-alone smartphone application and can be adopted as an extremely low-cost, fully handheld, easy-to-use, yet sensitive and specific quality control method for appraising red wine or similar beverage products in resource-limited environments.Stemple, C.

Journal of Laboratory Automation, 19(1), 35-41.More infoAbstract: A novel smartphone-based detection device was created to detect infectious pathogens directly from diluted (10%) human whole blood. The model pathogen was histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2), an antigen specific to Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). Anti-HRP-2-conjugated submicrobeads were mixed with HRP-2-infused 10% blood in a lab-on-a-chip device. The white LED flash and the digital camera of the smartphone were used as light source and detector, which delivered light to and from the bead and blood mixture via optofluidic channels in the lab-on-a-chip. The optofluidic channels were angled at 45 degrees to capture the Mie scatter from the sample. Considering the absorption and scattering characteristics of blood (red/infrared preferred) and the Mie scatter simulations for microbead immunoagglutination (UV preferred), blue detection showed the best results. The detection limit was 1 pg/mL in 10% blood. The linear range was from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. A handheld device, easily attachable to a single smartphone, was finally designed and fabricated using optical mirrors and lenses and successfully detected the HRP-2 from 10% blood. The total assay time was approximately 10 min. The proposed device can potentially be used for detecting a wide range of blood infection with high sensitivity. 2013 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.Yoon, J. (2014).

Resource: Engineering and Technology for Sustainable World, 21(1), 20-22.More infoAbstract: It is desirable to conduct reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or an immunoassay at the point-of-care level or in the field for early diagnosis of influenza. The lab-on-a-chip (LOC) is the perfect instrument to perform such a task. An LOC is a network of channels and wells that is etched onto a silicon or polymer substrate to build a miniature laboratory. The LOC enables sample handing, mixing, dilution, separation, staining, and detection within a single, integrated system and is perfectly suitable for chemical or biological assays. Final detections in an LOC can be made electrochemically or optically, but optical detection is gaining popularity due to its high sensitivity and better specificity. Optical detection in an LOC can be implemented through the use of an LED light source, a pair of optical fibers, and a miniature spectrometer.Fronczek, C. F., You, D. J., & Yoon, J. (2013). Single-pipetting microfluidic assay device for rapid detection of Salmonella from poultry package. Biosensors & bioelectronics, 40(1), 342-349.More infoA direct, sensitive, near-real-time, handheld optical immunoassay device was developed to detect Salmonella typhimurium in the naturally occurring liquid from fresh poultry packages (hereafter chicken matrix), with just single pipetting of sample (i.e., no filtration, culturing and/or isolation, thus reducing the assay time and the error associated with them). Carboxylated, polystyrene microparticles were covalently conjugated with anti-Salmonella, and the immunoagglutination due to the presence of Salmonella was detected by reading the Mie scatter signals from the microfluidic channels using a handheld device. The presence of chicken matrix did not affect the light scatter signal, since the optical parameters (particle size d, wavelength of incident light lambda; and scatter angle theta) were optimized to minimize the effect of sample matrix (animal tissues and blood proteins, etc.). The sample was loaded into a microfluidic chip that was split into two channels, one pre-loaded with vacuum-dried, antibody-conjugated particles and the other with vacuum-dried, bovine serum albumin-conjugated particles. This eliminated the need for a separate negative control, effectively minimizing chip-to-chip and sample-to-sample variations. Particles and the sample were diffused in-channel through chemical agitation by Tween 80, also vacuum-dried within the microchannels. Sequential mixing of the sample to the reagents under a strict laminar flow condition synergistically improved the reproducibility and linearity of the assay. In addition, dried particles were shown to successfully detect lower Salmonella concentrations for up to 8 weeks. The handheld device contains simplified circuitry eliminating unnecessary adjustment stages, providing a stable signal, thus maximizing sensitivity. Total assay time was 10 min, and the detection limit 10 CFU/mL was observed in all matrices, demonstrating the suitability of this device for field assays.Fronczek, C. F., You, D. J., & Yoon, J.

B, Biointerfaces, 104, 318-325.More infoMicrometer and nanometer grooved surfaces have been determined to influence cellular orientation, morphology, and migration through contact guidance. Cells typically elongate along the direction of an underlying groove and often migrate with guidance provided by constraints of the pattern. This phenomenon has been studied primarily using linear grooves, post, or well patterns. We investigated the behavior of mouse embryonic fibroblasts on non-linear, sinusoidal wave grooves created via electron beam lithography on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) substrate that was spin-coated onto a positively charged glass surface. Three different wave patterns, with varying wavelengths and amplitudes, and two different line patterns were created. Cell orientation and adhesion was examined after 4, 24, and 48 h after cell seeding. Attachment strength was studied via subjecting cells on substrates to centrifugal force following a 24-h incubation period. For all wave patterns studied, it was noted that cells did not reside within the groove, rather they were observed to cross over each groove, residing both inside and outside of each wave pattern, aligning linearly along the long axis of the pattern. For the linear patterns, we observed that cells tended to reside within the grooves, consistent with previous observations. The ability to add texture to a surface to manipulate cell adhesion strength and growth with only localized attachment, maintaining free space in curvilinear microtopography underlying the cell, may be a useful addition for tissue engineering and the fabrication of novel biomedical devices.Gamboa, J.

Biological Engineering Transactions, 6(1), 17-28.More infoAbstract: An optofluidic lab-on-a-chip system and subsequent sampling procedure were developed for detecting bacteria from soil samples utilizing light scattering detection of immunoagglutination assay. This system and protocol detected the presence of Escherichia coli K12 from soil particles in near real-time (10 min) with a detection limit down to 1 CFU mL-1, which is superior to the conventional methods, such as plate counting or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. E. coli solutions were applied to the surface of a mock soil system and incubated overnight. The light scattering immunoagglutination assays using the optofluidic lab-on-a-chip showed two E. coli peaks over the soil depth, one at 1 cm and the other at 4 cm. Comparison with bacterial viability assay and Bradford protein assay revealed that smaller E. coli colonies were found at 1 cm depth and larger colonies at 4 cm, while free antigens adsorbed and desorbed more reversibly at both locations. The two peaks were explained by the two-step process of protein-surface interaction and gravitational force. The target molecules with small sizes (free antigens and single cells) arrived at the soil particle surface faster according to the diffusion model, and the larger E. coli colonies arrived later where the soil surface was already occupied. Because the free antigens adsorbed and desorbed in a more reversible manner, they could be found throughout the depth of the mock-up soil system, whereas the larger E. coli colonies traveled through the void space within soil particles via gravitational force and accumulated at the bottom of where the liquid reached. This work also demonstrates a device and procedure that could be potentially implemented in field studies.

Interaction with nanoscale topography: The use of nanowelltrapped charged ligand-bearing nanoparticle surfaces to modulate physiological focal adhesions in endothelial cells. ASME 2013 2nd Global Congress on NanoEngineering for Medicine and Biology, NEMB 2013.More infoAbstract: Achieving cell adhesion, growth and homeostasis on an underlying biomaterial surface may be a desirable feature in implant device design and tissue engineering. Insight has been gained from numerous cell patterning strategies where spatial cues and physical constraints have been shown to regulate the structure and function of cells. Despite significant advances in modifying substrates for cellular attachment, migration and proliferation, the achievement of confluent and aligned growth of functional endothelial cells on cardiovascular blood-contacting implants under physiologically significant wall shear stress has proven difficult. Recently we have reported on a method that enhances cellular adhesion under flow conditions on synthetic polymer surfaces, without reliance on pro-adhesive protein biomaterials, which are often thrombogenic. In this method we utilize electron beam lithography and size-dependent selfassembly to fabricate line arrays of nanowells allowing entrapment and retention of charged nanoparticles, covalently conjugated with a RGD adhesive ligand, GRGDSPK. This approach is an additive strategy of combining substrata topographic alteration, electrostatic charge and biochemical ligands, all uniquely incorporated as an ensemble of charged, ligand-bearing nanoparticles entrapped in arrays of nanowells. However, the modulation of endothelial cell physiologic mechanisms as a result of ensemble surface exposure remains to be characterized. In this report, we extend our studies and probe cell physiologic mechanisms altered as a result of nanofeatured surface exposure. We first examined the functional intactness or normalcy of endothelial cells adherent to the nanofeatured ensemble surface utilizing standard immunostaining and flow cytometry methods. We found 1-integrin expression dominated quiescent adherent endothelial cells while V3-integrins expression was more common in migratory cells. Endothelial cells were noted to express high levels of PECAM-1 over time when exposed to nanofeatured surface and RGD peptides. For understanding the contribution of the nanofeatured surface (entrapped RGD conjugated nanoparticles) to cell adhesion, cytochalasin B was used to alter cell spreading. Confocal microscopy illustrated the uptake of nanoparticles in endothelial cells on composite surfaces, as well as the inhibition of this endocytosis by cytochalasin B. After prohibiting the cells from engulfing nanoparticles, we found an 80% reduction in cell adhesion; suggesting that an endocytic mechanism might play a role in maintaining cell adhesion. Nanofeatured ensemble surfaces appear to be good substrates for achieving a high level of EC adhesion, with maintained growth and stability. Copyright 2013 by ASME.You, D. J., Park, T. S., & Yoon, J. (2013). Cell-phone-based measurement of TSH using Mie scatter optimized lateral flow assays. Biosensors & bioelectronics, 40(1), 180-185.More infoSemi-quantitative thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFA) are used to screen for serum TSH concentration higher than 5 mIU/L (hypothyroidism). The LFA format, however, is unable to measure TSH in the normal range or detect suppressed levels of TSH (less than 0.4 mIU/L; hyperthyroidism). In fact, it does not provide quantitative TSH values at all. Obtaining quantitative TSH results, especially in the low concentration range, has until now required the use of centralized clinical laboratories which require specimen transport, specialized equipment and personnel, and result in increased cost and delays in the timely reporting of important clinical results. We have conducted a series of experiments to develop and validate an optical system and image analysis algorithm based upon a cell phone platform. It is able to provide point-of-care quantitative TSH results with a high level of sensitivity and reproducibility comparable to that of a clinical laboratory-based third-generation TSH immunoassay. Our research approach uses the methodology of the optimized Rayleigh/Mie scatter detection by taking into consideration the optical characteristics of a nitrocellulose membrane and gold nanoparticles on an LFA for quantifying TSH levels. Using a miniature spectrometer, LED light source, and optical fibers on a rotating benchtop apparatus, the light intensity from different angles of incident light and angles of detection to the LFA were measured. The optimum angles were found that the minimized Mie scattering from nitrocellulose membrane, consequently maximizes the Rayleigh scatter detection from the gold nanoparticles in the LFA bands. Using the results from the benchtop apparatus, a cell-phone-based apparatus was designed which utilized the embedded flash in the cell phone camera as the light source, piped the light with an optical fiber from the flash through a collimating lens to illuminate the LFA. Quantification of TSH was performed in an iOS application directly on the phone and verified using the code written in MATLAB. The limit of detection of the system was determined to be 0.31 mIU/L (never achieved before on an LFA format), below the commonly accepted minimum concentration of 0.4 mIU/L indicating clinical significance of hyperthyroidism. The system was further evaluated using human serum showing an accurate and reproducible platform for rapid and point-of-care quantification of TSH using a cell phone.You, D. J., Park, T.

Field-deployable and near-real-time optical microfluidic biosensors for single-oocyst-level detection of Cryptosporidium parvum from field water samples. Journal of Environmental Monitoring, 14(12), 3295-3304.More infoPMID: 23152174;Abstract: Cryptosporidium spp. is an obligate, parasitic protozoan that is difficult to detect and causes diarrhea in healthy adults while potentially causing death in the immunocompromised and children. Its treatment options are few and treat the symptoms, not the actual parasite. Current methods of detection are inefficient and rely too heavily upon laboratory sample preparations and technician skill, including differential staining, negative staining, and immunofluorescence methods [especially U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method 1623]. These assays can take from hours to days and require a laboratory environment. In this work, we demonstrated the microbead immunoagglutination assay combined with Mie scatter detection in a microfluidic device to provide a field-deployable and near-real-time alternative to the laboratory-based method (especially EPA Method 1623). Two main challenges were the relatively big diameter of Cryptosporidium oocysts (5-6 m) and the contaminants in field water samples that negatively affected the immunoagglutination and its scatter detection. We used 4 min sonication to liberate Cryptosporidium oocyst wall proteins (COWP), which was previously used to inactivate Cryptosporidium oocysts. As for the contaminants, we optimized the microbead diameter (920 nm) and the wavelength of incident light (375 nm) to find the angle of scatter detection (45) where the Mie scatter from immunoagglutinated microbeads was maximum and the background scatter from contaminants was minimum. This enabled the sub-single-oocyst-level detection despite the fact that only a very small volume of water sample (15 L) was introduced to the microfluidic biosensor. When combined with filtration/concentration, this method is able to detect 1 oocyst per large volume of water, comparable to or potentially better than the EPA method 1623, while effectively reducing the time and labor necessary for staining and microscopic analysis. For faster, near-real-time assays, filtration/ concentration may not be used, where the detection limit was 1-10 oocysts per mL with the total assay time of 10 min including the 4 min sonication time. The linear range of assay was over 5 orders of magnitude. The final device was compact and had the potential to be used in field situations, and required less technical expertise and/or training compared to the other methods.

Low-level detection of Cryptosporidium parvum in field water using optical microfluidic biosensors. Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE, 8229.More infoAbstract: Cryptosporidium parvum is a difficult-to-detect protozoan that causes diarrhea in the healthy adults and death in immunocompromised individuals. While it is easy to understand the transmission routes of Cryptosporidium, it is currently difficult to identify low concentrations of Cryptosporidium, especially when following EPA method 1623, which can easily require tens of liters of water to get a positive signal. The current detection method is unacceptable and severely inefficient when taking into account the time that goes into concentrating a sample, actual assays, and training associated with the assays. Using our method, it is possible to use only 15 L of sample, which is an immunoagglutination assay that uses Mie scatter intensity changes to detect different Cryptosporidium concentrations. In addition to creating a standard curve using a clean sample matrix (i.e., phosphate buffered saline), field samples were collected from a chlorine treated swimming pool, a sump located on a farm, and a turtle pond. Each sample had different intensity changes but the trend represented within the data was the same. This assay has a detection limit of 100-101 oocysts/mL and can be done in as little as 10 minutes. 2012 SPIE.Stemple, C. C., Kwon, H., & Yoon, J. (2012).

Some argue that biomedical engineering should be included as a subset of biological engineering. The reality is that a substantial number of ABE departments retain the word 'agricultural' in their department name, even though their undergraduate programs do not. Many interdepartmental or interdisciplinary graduate programs in biomedical engineering are converting to stand-alone departments that offer undergraduate programs, and they are attracting large numbers of students. BMES, the governing society for biomedical engineering is thriving, with a rapid increase in membership.

Droplets were manipulated using " wire-guided" method (a pipette tip was used in this study). This methodology can be easily adapted to existing commercial robotic pipetting system, while demonstrated added capabilities such as vibrational mixing, high-speed centrifuging of droplets, simple DNA extraction utilizing the hydrophobicity difference between the tip and the superhydrophobic surface, and rapid thermocycling with a moving droplet, all with wire-guided droplet manipulations on a superhydrophobic surface and a multi-chambered PCB heater (i.e., not on a 96-well plate). Serial dilutions were demonstrated for diluting sample matrix. Centrifuging was demonstrated by rotating a 10 L droplet at 2300 round per minute, concentrating E. coli by more than 3-fold within 3 min. DNA extraction was demonstrated from E. coli sample utilizing the disposable pipette tip to cleverly attract the extracted DNA from the droplet residing on a superhydrophobic surface, which took less than 10 min. Following extraction, the 1500 bp sequence of Peptidase D from E. coli was amplified using rapid droplet thermocycling, which took 10 min for 30 cycles. The total assay time was 23 min, including droplet centrifugation, droplet DNA extraction and rapid droplet thermocycling. Evaporation from of 10 L droplets was not significant during these procedures, since the longest time exposure to air and the vibrations was less than 5 min (during DNA extraction). The results of these sequentially executed processes were analyzed using gel electrophoresis.

Mie scattering simulations were able to predict the shape of the PRRSV standard curve, indicating that any non-linearity of the standard curve can be interpreted purely as an optical phenomenon. Each assay took less than 5 min. A strong correlation could be found between RT-PCR and this method for the lung tissue samples, even though their respective detection mechanisms are different fundamentally (nucleic acids for RT-PCR and virus antigens for light scattering immunoagglutination assay). Several different dilution factors were also tested for tissue samples, and 1/10 and 1/100 were found to be usable. If the microfluidic chips are used only once (i.e. without re-using them), both superior sensitivity and satisfactory specificity can be demonstrated. Specificity studies revealed the presence of Type II PRRSV and non-presence of Type I PRRSV and that the microfluidic chip assay could detect Type II North American strain of PRRSV for the animals tested.

Biosensors & bioelectronics, 28(1), 399-406.More infoDirect and sensitive detection of foodborne pathogens from fresh produce samples was accomplished using a handheld lab-on-a-chip device, requiring little to no sample processing and enrichment steps for a near-real-time detection and truly field-deployable device. The detection of Escherichia coli K12 and O157:H7 in iceberg lettuce was achieved utilizing optimized Mie light scatter parameters with a latex particle immunoagglutination assay. The system exhibited good sensitivity, with a limit of detection of 10 CFU/mL and an assay time of <6 min. Minimal pretreatment with no detrimental effects on assay sensitivity and reproducibility was accomplished with a simple and cost-effective KimWipes filter and disposable syringe. Mie simulations were used to determine the optimal parameters (particle size d, wavelength lambda, and scatter angle theta) for the assay that maximize light scatter intensity of agglutinated latex microparticles and minimize light scatter intensity of the tissue fragments of iceberg lettuce, which were experimentally validated. This introduces a powerful method for detecting foodborne pathogens in fresh produce and other potential sample matrices. The integration of a multi-channel microfluidic chip allowed for differential detection of the agglutinated particles in the presence of the antigen, revealing a true field-deployable detection system with decreased assay time and improved robustness over comparable benchtop systems. Additionally, two sample preparation methods were evaluated through simulated field studies based on overall sensitivity, protocol complexity, and assay time. Preparation of the plant tissue sample by grinding resulted in a two-fold improvement in scatter intensity over washing, accompanied with a significant increase in assay time: 5 min (grinding) versus 1 min (washing). Specificity studies demonstrated binding of E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 to only O157:H7 antibody conjugated particles, with no cross-reactivity to K12.

Additionally, the PCR assay system should be made portable as a point-of-care detection tool. There have been attempts to further speed up the PCR assays by reducing its volume. There have also been attempts to use droplet microfluidics technology to PCR, primarily to automate the PCR enrichment processes and take advantage of its small volume. In all these attempts, heating and cooling is made by conduction heat transfer. Rapid movements of droplets (immersed in oil) over three different temperature zones make very quick PCR possible, as heating/cooling will be made by convection heat transfer, whose heat transfer coefficients are much higher than that of conduction. We used our newly-invented method of wire-guide droplet manipulations towards very quick RT-PCR. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of our system revealed that heating/cooling for each temperature change takes 1-4 s for a 10 L droplet, as compared to >30 s in the other quick PCRs. Theoretically a 30-cycle process can take as short as 13 s 30 cycles = 6 min 30 s.

The entire system was made as a single instrument, with the components made by a milling machine and a rapid prototyping device. No additional equipment and external computers are required. With this newly developed system, 160 bp gene sequence was amplified from 2009 H1N1 influenza A (human origin). The 30-cycle process took as short as 6 min 50 s for a 10 uL droplet (with additional 4 min for reverse transcription). Its product was confirmed by traditional gel electrophoresis, subsequent imaging as well as gene sequencing, which has been very difficult with the other stationary droplet/nanodrop approaches. The proposed system has a potential to become an extremely rapid, portable, point-of-care tool for detecting influenza A.Heinze, B. C., Gamboa, J. R., Kim, K., Song, J., & Yoon, J. (2010).

Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 398(6), 2693-2700.More infoPMID: 20859619;Abstract: This work presents the use of integrated, liquid core, optical waveguides for measuring immunoagglutinationinduced light scattering in a microfluidic device, towards rapid and sensitive detection of avian influenza (AI) viral antigens in a real biological matrix (chicken feces). Mie scattering simulations were performed and tested to optimize the scattering efficiency of the device through proper scatter angle waveguide geometry. The detection limit is demonstrated to be 1 pgmL-1 in both clean buffer and real biological matrix. This low detection limit is made possible through on-chip diffusional mixing of AI target antigens and high acid content microparticle assay reagents, coupledwith real-timemonitoring of immunoagglutination-induced forward Mie scattering via high refractive index liquid core optical waveguides in close proximity (100 m) to the sample chamber. The detection time for the assay is Kwon, H., Dean, Z. S., Angus, S. V., & Yoon, J. (2010).

JALA - Journal of the Association for Laboratory Automation, 15(3), 216-223.More infoAbstract: A field lab-on-a-chip system was constructed to detect mouse immunoglobulin G (mIgG; model protein target) and . Escherichia coli (. E. coli; model microorganism target) by using light scattering detection of particle immunoagglutination. The antibodies to these targets were conjugated to the submicron particles by covalent binding, and their long-term stability was evaluated. Antibody-conjugated particles were able to be stored in a 4. C refrigerator for at least 4 weeks and to be lyophilized as a powder form for the storage in room temperature. The optimum antibody coverage on the particles was 50% for mIgG and 100% for . E. coli in terms of assay sensitivity and long-term storage of reagents. Lab-on-a-chip device was fabricated from acrylic plate using an industrial-grade milling machine eliminating the need for photolithography and internal or external pumping. An automatic sampling system was constructed using drip emitters, such that the system can be connected to a pressurized water pipe for detecting . E. coli. The automatic sampling system generated the same volume of droplets (70. L) regardless of pressure. The developed system was successfully tested for . E. coli presence in field water samples. The system can potentially be connected to pressurized pipe networks for drinking, processing, irrigation, and wastewater. 2010.Kwon, H., Lee, C., Choi, E., Song, J., Heinze, B. C., & Yoon, J.

Journal of Environmental Monitoring, 12(11), 2138-2144.More infoPMID: 20886169;Abstract: Rapid monitoring of the spreads of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was attempted using samples collected from nasal swabs of pigs and air samplers within an experimental swine building. An optofluidic device containing liquid-core waveguides was used to detect forward Mie light scattering caused by the agglutination of anti-PRRSV-conjugated submicron particles, with enhanced sensitivity, signal reproducibility, and reusability (reusable up to 75 assays). These results were compared with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays (35 cycles) and showed excellent agreements to them. Each assay took less than 10 min including all necessary sample pre-processing, while the RT-PCR assays took up to 4 h including sample pre-processing and gel imaging for PCR products. A 3-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was utilized to track the transport and distribution of PRRSV (from the mouths of pigs to the exhaust fans) within a swine building, and compared with the readings from an optofluidic device. Simulation results corresponded well with the experimental data, validating our 3-D CFD model for the spread of viral pathogens in a livestock environment. The developed optofluidic device and 3-D CFD model can serve as a good model for monitoring the spread of influenza A (swine and avian) within animal and human environments. 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Tran, P.

Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 398(2), 759-768.More infoPMID: 20652550;PMCID: PMC2991207;Abstract: An alternative approach for fabricating a protein array at nanoscale is suggested with a capability of characterization and/or localization of multiple components on a nanoarray. Fluorescent micro- and nanobeads each conjugated with different antibodies are assembled by size-dependent self-assembly (SDSA) onto nanometer wells that were created on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) substrate by electron beam lithography (EBL). Antibody-conjugated beads of different diameters are added serially and electrostatically attached to corresponding wells through electrostatic attraction between the charged beads (confirmed by zeta potential analysis) and exposed p-doped silicon substrate underneath the PMMA layer. This SDSA method is enhanced by vibrated-wire-guide manipulation of droplets on the PMMA surface containing nanometer wells. Saturation rates of antibody-conjugated beads to the nanometer patterns are up to 97% under one component and 58-70% under two components nanoarrays. High-density arrays (up to 40,000 wells) could be fabricated, which can also be multi-component. Target detection utilizes fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from fluorescent beads to fluorescent-tagged secondary antibodies to Octamer-4 (Oct4), which eliminates the need for multiple steps of rinsing. The 100 nm green beads are covalently conjugated with anti-Oct4 to capture Oct4 peptides (39 kDa); where the secondary anti-Oct4 and F(ab)2 fragment of anti-gIgG tagged with phycoerythrin are then added to function as an indicator of Oct4 detection. FRET signals are detected through confocal microscopes, and further confirmed by Fluorolog3 spectrofluorometer. The success rates of detecting Oct4 are 32% and 14% of the beads in right place under one and two component nanoarrays, respectively. Ratiometric FRET is used to quantify the amount of Oct4 peptides per each bead, which is estimated about 2 molecules per bead. 2010 Springer-Verlag.Yoon, J., & Kwon, H. (2010). Biosensor detection CS of an airborne mystery disease. Resource: Engineering and Technology for Sustainable World, 17(5), 5-7.More infoAbstract: The use of a field-deployable biosensor device in a networked system in a real animal/human environment is important to monitor the spread of dangerous viral pathogens. Surrogate molecules have been used to perform experimental monitoring and/or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies, including smoke (for particulate movement) and CO2 (to simulate respiration). The current standard for detecting both porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) and influenza A is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which may take up to four hours to perform, including sample pre-processing, reverse transcription, thermocycling, and gel imaging for product identification. A lab-on-a-chip (LOC) is used to monitor airborne pathogens and enable to perform sample handling, mixing, dilution, electrophoresis, staining, and detection in a single integrated system. The three-dimensional CFD model would serve as a good model for monitoring the spread of many other viral pathogens within animal and human environments.Han, J., & Yoon, J. (2009). Reusable, polyethylene glycol-structured microfluidic channel for particle immunoassays. Journal of Biological Engineering, 3.More infoPMID: 19400962;PMCID: PMC2680825;Abstract: A microfluidic channel made entirely out of polyethylene glycol (PEG), not PEG coating to silicon or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, was fabricated and tested for its reusability in particle immunoassays and passive protein fouling, at relatively high target concentrations (1 mg ml-1). The PEG devices were reusable up to ten times while the oxygen-plasma-treated polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) device could be reused up to four times and plain PDMS were not reusable. Liquid was delivered spontaneously via capillary action and complicated bonding procedure was not necessary. The contact angle analysis revealed that the water contact angle on microchannel surface should be lower than 60, which are comparable to those on dried protein films, to be reusable for particle immunoassays and passive protein fouling. 2009 Han and Yoon; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.Han, J., Kwon, H., Yoon, J., Kim, K., Nam, S., & Son, J. E. (2009). Analysis of the thermal environment in a mushroom house using sensible heat balance and 3-D computational fluid dynamics. Biosystems Engineering, 104(3), 417-424.More infoAbstract: An environmental prediction model was developed for optimal ventilation in a mushroom house utilising a sensible heat balance and a three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The respiration of the mushrooms and the use of a low-capacity cooler were considered. A mushroom-house-specific ventilation equation was developed to calculate the ventilation rate for a given environmental condition. Calculated ventilation rates were compared with the experimentally measured data for the indoor temperature set to the optimum for growing mushrooms (16.2 C) with varying outdoor temperature. There was good agreement between the measured and predicted rates (0.2-5.1% error). Calculated ventilation rates (from the sensible heat balance) were used as an input parameter for 3-D CFD model, eliminating the need for experimental measurement of ventilation rate. 3-D CFD simulations were conducted using the same environmental condition to establish the local heat distribution in a mushroom house. The simulation results for temperature were compared with the experimental data at several different locations in a mushroom house and showed negligible errors. The CFD model was also used to improve heat distribution of a mushroom house. It was predicted that enhanced cooling and more uniform temperature distribution could be achieved just by changing the direction of airflow from air inlet ducts and/or installing small fans onto them, but not by changing the directions of airflow from a cooler. This would be a more economical than replacing a cooler or redesigning the entire structure. The model could be used to predict the environmental conditions over different locations in a mushroom house without the need for experimentally determining the ventilation rate. 2009 IAgrE.Heinze, B.

The model viral target was bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Highly carboxylated polystyrene microparticles (510 nm) were coated with anti-BVDV monoclonal antibodies.

The assay was first performed in a two well slide format for proof of concept and particle stability experiments, then in a simple y-channel microfluidic chip with optical fibers arranged in a close proximity setup. Microparticle immunoagglutination was detected via static forward light scattering measurements taken at 45 to incident light. In the microfluidic chip, BVDV was detected down to a concentration of 10 TCID50 mL-1. For assay comparison purposes reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on serial dilutions of the BVDV sample used in the two well and microfluidic testing. RT-PCR was effective down to a concentration of 103 TCID50 mL-1 in detecting the identical BVDV used for microfluidic assays. 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Powell, T. B., Tran, P.

Protein binding is confirmed from the fluorescence attenuation of the beads upon antigen-antibody binding on the bead surface. This method, called size-dependent self-assembly, allows control of the location of each type of bead, and thus, control of the location of multiple proteins. It provides fast multi-component patterning with a high binding resolution, which can be detected using a fluorescent light microscope. This method is developed to be a simple stand-alone tool for analysis of protein interactions. In addition, it has the potential to be used in conjunction with other protein analysis methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). 2009 Elsevier B.V.Tran, P.

Clearly, real-time and extremely sensitive detection of these pathogens is needed to ensure that produce-related farming procedures are safe. In our study, we demonstrated that the use of a microfluidic system can detect Escherichia coli in a water pipe at laminar and turbulent flow regimes. A one-step latex immunoagglutination assay was performed within a microfluidic device that uses fiber optics to detect pathogens. The results were then successfully validated by using cultured E. coli and a salt tracer. The detection of the E. coli was thus accomplished in real time (Yoon, J., & Riley, M. R. (2009).

Biological engineers, having tools and techniques at the interface between living and non-living entities, will play a prominent role in forging a better future. The 2010 Institute of Biological Engineering (IBE) conference in Cambridge, MA, USA will address, in part, the roles of biological engineering in solving the challenges presented by the NAE.

Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE, 7313.More infoAbstract: Virus antigens of avian influenza subtype H3N2 were detected on two different microfluidic platforms: microchannel and droplet. Latex immunoagglutination assays were performed using 920-nm highly carboxylated polystyrene beads that are conjugated with antibody to avian influenza virus. The bead suspension was merged with the solutions of avian influenza virus antigens in a Y-junction of a microchannel made by polydimethylsiloxane soft lithography. The resulting latex immunoagglutinations were measured with two optical fibers in proximity setup to detect 45 forward light scattering. Alternatively, 10 L droplets of a bead suspension and an antigen solution were merged on a superhydrophobic surface (water contact angle = 155), whose movement was guided by a metal wire, and 180 back light scattering is measured with a backscattering optical probe. Detection limits were 0.1 pg mL-1 for both microchannel with proximity fibers and droplet microfluidics, thanks to the use of micro-positioning stages to help generate reproducible optical signals. Additionally, optical waveguide was tested by constructing optical waveguide channels (filled with mineral oil) within a microfluidic device to detect the same light scattering. Detection limit was 0.1 ng mL-1 for an optical waveguide device, with a strong potential of improvement in the near future. The use of optical waveguide enabled smaller device setup, easier operation, smaller standard deviations and broader linear range of assay than proximity fiber microchannel and droplet microfluidics.

Pre-treatments such as cell lysis or culturing to enhance the signal were not used. Proximity optical fibers around the view cell of the device were used to quantify the increase in 45 forward light scattering of the immunoagglutinated particles. In order to reduce false positive signals caused by antibodies binding to non-viable E. coli cells or free antigens in solution, target solutions were washed three times, and then the results were compared to non-washing treatments. The detection limit was found to be less than 10 cfu ml-1 (1 cfu per device) without PBS washing (thus detecting non-viable cells and free antigens), or less than 40 cfu ml-1 (4 cfu per device) with PBS washing (thus detecting viable E. coli cells only). 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Programmed and motorized movements of 10 L droplets were demonstrated using stepper motors and microcontrollers, including merging, complicated movement along the programmed path, and rapid mixing. Latex immunoagglutination assays for mouse immunoglobulin G, bovine viral diarrhea virus and Escherichia coli were demonstrated by merging two droplets on a superhydrophobic surface (contact angle = 155 2) and using subsequent back light scattering detection, with detection limits of 50 pg mL-1, 2.5 TCID50 mL-1 and 85 CFU mL-1, respectively, all significantly lower than the other immunoassay demonstrations in conventional microfluidics (1 ng mL-1 for proteins, 100 TCID50 mL-1 for viruses and 100 CFU mL-1 for bacteria). Advantages of this system over conventional microfluidics or microwell plate assays include: (1) minimized biofouling and repeated use (>100 times) of a platform; (2) possibility of nanoliter droplet manipulation; (3) reprogrammability with a computer or a game pad interface. 2008 Yoon and You; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.Han, J., Kim, K., & Yoon, J.

Analytica Chimica Acta, 584(2), 252-259.More infoPMID: 17386612;Abstract: Latex immunoagglutination assay in a microfluidic device is expected to be even easier than its large-sized, commercialized counterpart. However, such demonstration has had a limited success due to the difficulties in mixing in a microfluidic device, especially for the microparticles used in latex immunoagglutination assay. The primary goal of this work is to improve diffusional mixing towards the successful latex immunoagglutination in a microfluidic devices without any non-specific binding. To this end, SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate, an ionic surfactant) or Tween 80 (polyethylene sorbitol ester, a non-ionic surfactant) was added to the antibody-conjugated polystyrene (PS) microparticle suspension. These surfactant-added particle suspensions were mixed with the target antigen solution at the Y-junction of a microfluidic device. The immunoagglutination and the diffusion behavior were visually identified with an inverted light microscope. Both surfactants showed some problems such as non-specific binding (with SDS) or very poor diffusion (with Tween 80). As an alternative approach, therefore, highly carboxylated PS microparticles, where the surface is saturated with carboxyl-terminated side chains, were evaluated without using any surfactants. These particles showed very low non-specific binding comparable to that with Tween 80 and good diffusional mixing equivalent to that with SDS. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Japan Agricultural Research Quarterly, 41(4), 283-290.More infoAbstract: A CFD model was developed to simulate the air temperature and relative humidity distribution in greenhouses adopting fog-cooling systems using FLUENT. The developed model was validated using the data from a fog-cooling experiment in a single-span greenhouse without plants. The measured and simulated air temperatures varied from 0.1 to 1.4C and the differences of relative humidity varied 0.3-6.0%. The validated model was then used to evaluate the design of a fog-cooling system in a multi-span glasshouse. The optimal system design was determined in terms of the cooling efficiency and the special uniformity of air temperature and relative humidity. The simulations demonstrated that the best performance of the cooling system occurred when the fog nozzles were located at the height of 2.3 m above the floor and at a distance of 1.9 m from the sidewalls with uniform row-to-row spacing of 3.7 m. The most effective location of the nozzles was within the air entry from the sidewall ventilator inlets of the greenhouse. However, it was important not to wet the sidewalls with the fog. This study suggested that the CFD model developed could be a useful tool to design and evaluate the fog-cooling systems in greenhouses with various configurations.Lucas, L. J., Chesler, J.

We conjugated quantum dots (QDs) onto microspheres to enable multiplex assays as well as to enhance the limit of detection (LOD). We named this configuration "nano-on-micro" or "NOM". Upon radiation with UV light (380 nm), a stronger light scattering signal is observed with NOMs than QDs or microspheres alone. Additionally, NOMs are easier to handle than QDs. Since QDs also provide fluorescent emission, we are able to utilize an increase in light scattering for detecting antigen-antibody reaction and a decrease in QD emission to identify which antibody (or antigen) is present. Two types of NOM combinations were used. One batch of microspheres was coated with QDs emitting at 655 nm and mouse IgG (mIgG); the other with QDs emitting at 605 nm and bovine serum albumin (BSA). A mixture of these two NOMs was used to identify either anti-mIgG or anti-BSA. NOM particles and target solutions were mixed in a microfluidic device (using highly carboxylated microspheres as previously demonstrated by our group) and on-chip detection was performed using proximity optical fibers. Forward light scattering at 380 nm was collected. With the positive target, the scattering signal was increased. The LOD was as low as 50 ng ml-1 (330 pM) with p < 0.05. Fluorescent emission (655 or 605 nm) was simultaneously collected. With the positive target, the emission signal was attenuated. Therefore, we were able to detect two different antibodies simultaneously with two different detection protocols. We believe this NOM bioassay has the ability to screen for and detect multiple antibodies with minimal sample processing and handling (one-step lab-on-a-chip immunoassay). 2007.Lucas, L.

These diagnostic methods must be rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective. In 2006, our group demonstrated a successful lab-on-a-chip immunoassay using microsphere light scattering, which is essentially a one-step, automated protocol, on a reusable chip.

A 400-m silica fiber was used to deliver blue light emitting diode (LED) or red laser light sources. A miniature, portable spectrometer was used to measure forward light scattering intensity collected by the same type of multi-mode fiber. To first show feasibility, anti-mouse IgG were used as target biomolecules and highly carboxylated polystyrene latex microspheres (510 nm) coated with mouse IgG were used as probes. Next, we tested for the vasculitis marker, anti-PR3, using the same type of microspheres coated with PR3 proteins. No false negatives or positives were observed. A limit of detection (LOD) of 50 ng mL-1 was demonstrated for the vasculitis marker, anti-PR3. (Plasma samples from patients with vasculitis exhibited anti-PR3 at a median level of 380 ng mL-1.) The optical detection system works without any fluorescence or chemiluminescence markers. The entire system proposed here is cost effective, small in size, and re-usable with simple rinsing.

Improved LOD of < 4.3 CFU ml-1 was achieved by measuring forward static light scattering from microfluidic device, using proximity optical fibers and a USB-powered miniature spectrometer. The total assay time for sample preparation (mostly dilutions) and on-chip assay (mostly injections and short incubation time) was < 10 min.Lucas, L. J., Han, J., & Yoon, J. (2006). Using highly carboxylated microspheres to simplify immunoassays and enhance diffusional mixing in a microfluidic device. Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 49(2), 106-111.More infoPMID: 16621472;Abstract: Manufacturers of latex immunoassays have typically added surfactants to improve detection sensitivity and prevent non-specific aggregation of microspheres, which may cause both false positives and negatives during diagnostic testing. There is also growing interest in conducting immunoassays in smaller volumes using microfluidic devices with minimum human effort. The first goal of our study was to simplify immunoassays by eliminating the use of surfactants. Our second objective was to determine if this strategy would also enhance diffusional mixing in a microfluidic channel, which has been one of the biggest barriers to using these devices. We first ran a series of cuvette experiments to document the performance of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) surfactants in a mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) immunoassay using plain polystyrene microspheres. Next, we tested highly carboxylated microspheres with no surfactants, to determine if the same levels of accuracy and specificity could be achieved. Finally, we evaluated the surfactants and highly carboxylated microspheres in a microfluidic device. Our results show that highly carboxylated microspheres can indeed be used to replace surfactants and to induce rapid mixing via diffusion in a microfluidic device. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Biotechnology Progress, 22(1), 106-110.More infoPMID: 16454499;Abstract: A new concept for line patterning of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in nanometer scale using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) self-assembled in a nanochannel written with an electron beam is proposed and demonstrated. AuNPs are synthesized by reducing KAuCl4 with NaBH4, producing AuNPs 40-70 nm in size, where Cl- ions are capping AuNPs thus making them negatively charged and subsequently stabilized. IgG is conjugated to these AuNPs by simple adsorption. Single or multiple nanochannels are written with an electron beam using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in a layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), which is spin-coated on a p-doped Si wafer. AuNPs bind into the etched nanochannel where the Si surface is exposed, while the relatively hydrophobic PMMA area repels the particles. The particles with a diameter larger than the channel width are not able to go inside of it. Anti-IgG, conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), is then exposed to the patterned surface, binding specifically to the IgG-AuNP conjugates within the line patterns. These antibody-antigen bindings can be visualized with a fluorescent microscope, showing the fluorescent signal only along with the nanometer line pattern. These initial steps will lead to the formation of complex protein nanoarrays, based on the size-dependent self-assembly of AuNPs within variously sized nanopatterns. 2006 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers.Powell, T., & Yoon, J. (2005). Self-assembly of gold nanoparticles on e-beam nano-patterns towards protein nanoarray. 2005 NSTI Nanotechnology Conference and Trade Show - NSTI Nanotech 2005 Technical Proceedings, 351-354.More infoAbstract: As our understanding of human diseases grows, so does our need to understand functions and pathways on a proteomic level. Protein arrays are a way of analyzing proteins and pathways within single molecule detection. A new concept of fabricating protein arrays based on self assembly of protein/gold nanoparticle conjugates onto nanometer patterns formed by e-beam lithography. Hydrophilic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are formed using the Brust-Schiffrin method without stabilizer, and are exposed to a model hydrophobic surface with hydrophilic patterns etched within. The AuNPs bind to the exposed hydrophilic surfaces, while the hydrophobic surfaces repel the gold. This method can be used to bind different proteins to specific size AuNPs, which in turn, when serially added to nanometer patterns, will self assemble onto their respective sized patterns.Yoon, J., Garrell, R. L., Choi, S., Kim, J., & Kim, W. (2005). Using a stirred cell to evaluate structural changes in proteins adsorbed on particles. AIChE Journal, 51(3), 1048-1052.More infoAbstract: A stirred cell technique was used to evaluate structural changes in proteins adsorbed on particles. Stirred cell geometry was used to obtain a series of breakthrough curves, which is the change in the concentration of the adsorbate in the effluent as a function of effluent volume. The breakthrough curves can be asymmetric, which arises from the combination of factors related to the efficiency of the sorption process. The substrate consisted of a 1.5 volume percent suspension of nonporous latex particles mixed at high rotation speed. The adsorption of proteins on to hydrophobic surfaces, such as polystyrenes (PS) was modeled as a two-step process, reversible adsorption until the surface was fully covered with protein molecules, followed by irreversible structural changes in the adlayer. The pH values were chosen to match the isoelectric point of each protein, to minimize electrostatic interactions between the proteins and the PS latex, and to simultaneously maximize the amount of protein adsorbing through hydrophobic interactions. The results show that structural changes can be assessed as a function of protein concentration, and may include orientational and/or conformational changes, association and dissociation.Choi, S., Park, J., Chang, Y., Yoon, J., Haam, S., Kim, J., & Kim, W. (2003). Effect of electrostatic repulsive force on the permeate flux and flux modeling in the microfiltration of negatively charged microspheres. Separation and Purification Technology, 30(1), 69-77.More infoAbstract: A study on the permeate flux was performed in a stirred cell filled with monodispersed carboxylated microspheres (polystyrene/polymethacrylic acid, PS/PMAA), to investigate the effects of surface charge (the number density of surface carboxyl group, Nc; 0.45, 5.94, 9.14, and 10.25 nm-2) and the stirrer speed (300, 400, and 600 rpm) under constant transmembrane pressure. The permeate flux was found to be dependent on the surface charge, the ionic strength, and the stirrer speed. The permeate flux was proportional to the surface charge of microspheres and inversely proportional to the ionic strength because of electrostatic repulsive interaction and steric hindrance. The cake porosity was estimated by Kozeny-Carman equation from the steady-state permeate flux data. Experimental data elucidated that the cake porosity was extended from 0.211 to 3.04 upon the introduction of carboxyl group on the microsphere surface, leading to the high permeate flux. Consequently, resistance-in-series model was employed for the modeling of the permeate flux and showed a good agreement with the experimental results. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Effects of surface characteristics on non-specific agglutination in latex immunoagglutination antibody assay. Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 27(1), 3-9.More infoAbstract: To monitor the non-specific agglutination (NSA) in latex immunoagglutination assay, antigen-coated structured latex particles, which have carboxyl and sulphonate groups as hydrophilic domains, were tested for an antibody assay. Sulphonated particles showed NSA in high antibody concentrations, where no surface antigen left to match with. This was further justified with the more stable highly sulphonated particles, which showed higher degree of NSA. It can therefore be confirmed that sulphonate groups cause (or at least promote) NSA, while carboxyl groups do not. Surface coverage over 17% was not fully utilized for antigen-antibody reaction, due to the prozone effect. The difference in sensitivity of particles was explained in terms of our new explanations on the governing interactions of protein adsorption. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Analytical Chemistry, 75(19), 5097-5102.More infoAbstract: Electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is a new method for moving liquids in biofluidic chips through electrical modification of the surface hydrophobicity. EWOD-based devices are reconfigurable, have low power requirements, and can handle neutral and charged analytes, as well as particulates. We show that biomolecular adsorption in EWOD is minimized by limiting the time during which no potential is applied and through choice of solution pH and electrode polarity. The same approach may be useful for controlling biomolecular adsorption in other applications of hydrophobic dielectric materials. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing EWOD for fluid actuation in biofluidic chips.Choi, S., Yoon, J., Haam, S., Jung, J., Kim, J., & Kim, W. (2000). Modeling of the permeate flux during microfiltration of BSA-adsorbed microspheres in a stirred cell. Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 228(2), 270-278.More infoAbstract: A study on the variation of the permeate flux was performed in a stirred cell charged with microspheres, to investigate the effects of the stirrer speeds (300, 400, and 600 rpm) and the BSA concentration (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/L) under constant pressure. The permeate flux increased over time before the saturation point, but it began to decrease after that point. An increase of the BSA concentration and the stirrer speed resulted in the rapid increase of the permeate flux. This is contrary to the observation of the conventional filtration experiments using a stirred cell. A resistance-in-series model was employed for the modeling of the permeate flux. The cake resistance (R(c), induced by the concentration polarization of microspheres) and the fouling resistance (R(f), induced by the adsorption of BSA inside the membrane pore) must be considered simultaneously for the modeling. These modeling results were in good agreement with the experimental data. These can be applied to the special system considering both R(c) and R(f) as well as the general filtration systems using a stirred cell. (C) 2000 Academic Press.Yoon, J., Kim, J., & Kim, W. (1999). The relationship of interaction forces in the protein adsorption onto polymeric microspheres. Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects, 153(1-3), 413-419.More infoAbstract: The relationship between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in protein adsorption was studied with various sulfonated microspheres, and it was compared with carboxylated microspheres. Hydrophobic interaction governed the adsorption in the low sulfonated microspheres and electrostatic interaction did in the high sulfonated ones. The transition point was observed when the two forces were exactly balanced, but it was shifted to the left compared to the case of the carboxylated microspheres. The above adsorption experiments with different kinds of surface functionality revealed the following general mechanism of protein adsorption. The protein adsorption mainly occurs by hydrophobic interaction when the hydrophobic surface is slightly modified with weak or strong acid, while it primarily occurs by hydrogen bonding (or electrostatic) interaction when the surface is mostly modified with weak (or strong) acid. The adsorption by electrostatic interaction is higher than that by any other interactions, but the rate of adsorption is slowest. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.Lee, J.

Biomedical Chromatography, 12(6), 330-334.More infoPMID: 9861492;Abstract: We contrived a new separation system using a stirred cell charged with uncoupled microsphere similar to the chromatographic separation. Microspheres, carboxylated PS/PMAA and sulfonated PS/PNaSS, were prepared by emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization. To complement the submicron size weakness and the absence of ligands, we employed the latex form, the dispersion of microsphere, and took advantage of interaction relationships between proteins and microspheres. Adsorption isotherm is contemplated to investigate continuous separation behaviours of serum proteins. Selectivity of separation is in the following order: PS/PNaSS-2.0 (high sulfonated) < PS/PNaSS-0.3 (low sulfonated) < PS/PMAA-0.5 (low carboxylated). Unlike previous works on batch separation, not only the adsorbed amount in equilibrium (C(m)), but also adsorption coefficient (K), played an important role in continuous separation. Functional groups (carboxyl and sulfonate), induced from the co-monomer, also affected the adsorption behaviours.Seo, J., Yoon, J., Oh, J., & Kim, W. (1998). Optimum growth conditions and pH control solution for PHB biosynthesis in A. eutrophus. Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 4(3), 215-220.More infoAbstract: Optimum growth conditions and pH control solution were obtained in the biosynthesis of PHB(poly--hydroxybutyrate) with Alcaligenes eutrophus. Optimum carbon and nitrogen sources were fructose and (NH4) 2SO4, respectively, and optimum additive was 1:1 mixture of yeast extract and polypeptone. To select the optimum pH control solution, various pH control solutions (NaOH, KOH, Na2CO3, and NaOH+KOH) were tested. Na2CO3 solution was found to be the best out of the four solutions tested, because CO2 generated from Na2CO3 could be used as a carbon source. Mixture of NaOH and KOH showed better results than the solution of NaOH or KOH alone. This could be due to the balanced amount of cations (Na+ and K+), which might promote not only the permeation of substrates, but also pumping out Na+ ions.Yoon, J., Kim, J., & Kim, W. (1998). Interpretation of protein adsorption phenomena onto functional microspheres.

Bovine serum albumin adsorbed onto carboxylated microspheres always undergoes an irreversible conformational change to the end-on mode, while this would not occur around the transition point in the case of the sulfonated microspheres.

Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces, 10(6), 365-377.More infoAbstract: Submicron microspheres were used directly without ligand coupling for the batch and continuous separations of proteins. In the batch experiments for separating BSA (bovine serum albumin) from BHb (bovine hemoglobin), introducing both hydrophobic effects for BSA and electrostatic repulsion for BHb (and vice versa) was required for high selectivity, and microspheres with low number density of surface groups were advantageous. For the continuous experiments, the utilization of a stirred cell was successful, where the microspheres were in the form of latex with good dispersion of particles. The flow rate without a pump was 0.5-1.3 ml min-1, and the ratio of BSA and BHb was varied. In the experiments for eliminating BHb from BSA, elution curves of BHb corresponded to the single component breakthrough curves, while those for BSA did not. The latter is believed to be due to the interference by BHb in the adsorption of BSA.Yoon, J., Park, H., Kim, J., & Kim, W. (1996). Adsorption of BSA on highly carboxylated microspheres - Quantitative effects of surface functional groups and interaction forces. Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 177(2), 613-620.More infoAbstract: In order to elucidate the relations between the amount of surface functional groups and interaction forces, BSA adsorption experiments were performed, using highly carboxylated PS/PMAA microspheres as well as conventional ones. Two kinds of interaction forces were considered in this study, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, while ionic interactions were assumed to be small or constant. Hydrophobic interactions were dominant in the low Nc (number density of surface carboxyl groups) region, below 1 carboxyl group nm-2, and were relatively sensitive to pH, while hydrogen bonding was dominant in the high Nc region, above 2 carboxyl groups nm-2, irrespective of pH. The transition region between these two interaction forces was 1 2 carboxyl groups nm-2 on the surface of a microsphere. When comparing the two extremes of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding, the latter was stronger, which was different from earlier studies. It can be explained that the conventional carboxylated microspheres do not have enough carboxyl groups on their surfaces. Adsorption constant K diminished as Nc increased, which means that the affinity itself is reduced by hydrogen bonding. Adsorbed layer thicknesses calculated from the Cm (adsorbed amount in equilibrium) were 4.66 7.08 nm; this means that the BSA molecules exist between the side-on and end-on mode. 1996 Academic Press, Inc.Proceedings PublicationsChung, S., Breshears, L.

In ASABE Annual International Meeting, 2017, 1701234.More infoDetection of norovirus from water samples typically requires extremely low limit of detection (LOD), preferably at single virus particle level, since they can be pathogenic at extremely low concentrations. Complicated equipment and/or lengthy procedures are necessary to concentrate large volume of water sample. In addition, this low LOD requirement have traditionally been associated non-reproducible and less convincing assay results. In this work, rapid and reliable detection of norovirus contamination in water samples was demonstrated using an in-house developed smartphone-based fluorescence microscope and a paper microfluidic analytic device (PAD). Norovirus was concentrated directly on the PAD, which was fabricated with polarity filter, to further decrease the LOD. Antibody-conjugated submicron (0.5 m diameter) fluorescent particles were added to this PAD, and a smartphone based fluorescence microscope imaged these beads directly from the PAD. Since the spatial resolution of our smartphone-based fluorescence microscope is > 1 m, only the beads immunoaggltuinated by norovirus can be identified, providing reliable, reproducible, and visually convincing assay results. Using this novel this method, extremely low LOD was demonstrated, 0.01 pg/mL with a benchtop fluorescence microscope and 10 pg/mL to 100 pg/mL with a smartphone based fluorescence microscope. This novel assay can provide a fully unmanned platform for assaying various waterborne pathogens that require extremely low LOD as well as high reliability, while providing low-cost, ease-of-use, and user friendliness appropriate for field applications.McCracken, K. E., Tat, T., Paz, V., Reynolds, K. A., & Yoon, J. (2017, Jul.). Immunoagglutinated Particle Rheology Sensing on a Microfluidic Paper-Based Analytical Device for Pathogen Detection. In ASABE Annual International Meeting, 2017, 1701190.More infoParticle immunoagglutination assays have been successfully used in biological sensing for food, water, and environmental applications and medical diagnostics. In this method, interactions between antibody-conjugated particles and biological targets are typically quantified by optical-based sensing, including Mie scattering detection. While these optical methods demonstrate favorable sensitivity and specificity, those that measure light intensity changes are vulnerable to environmental perturbations, such as variations in ambient lighting or humidity. In this work, we investigated a new sensing method based on the particle rheology of immunoagglutinated samples, as seen in droplet spreading on a microfluidic paper-based analytical device (PAD). By monitoring the overall bulk movement of a particle suspension on paper, these assays are not as critically affected by the sensing environment. Capillary flow of the particle suspension on PAD channels was tuned by adjusting various parameters, including paper thickness, channel width, channel morphology, particle concentration, and particle size. We then tested the most favorable lateral flow channel design for E. coli K12 sensing in water samples, and applied this overall technique to Zika virus (ZIKV) sensing in biological matrices. From these assays, we achieved similar limits of detection as compared with other demonstrated methods (2 log CFU/mL E. coli; 0.53x10^4 transcription copies/mL). Based on this work, direct detection of immunoagglutinated particle rheology through droplet spreading shows promise as a unique and simple method with applications in automated biosensors for environmental and health samples.Yoon, J.
