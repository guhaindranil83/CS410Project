Sandhage is the Reilly Professor of Materials Engineering. He received a B.S. (1981) in Metallurgical Engineering with highest distinction from Purdue University and a Ph.D. (1986) in Ceramics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After working for 5 years in industry (as a Senior Scientist at both Corning, Inc. and American Superconductor Corp.), he joined the Materials Science & Engineering Dept. at Ohio State University. In 2003, he moved to the School of Materials Science & Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he was the B. Mifflin Hood Professor. In the fall of 2015, Dr. Sandhage joined the School of Materials Engineering at Purdue. The Sandhage group has pioneered the development of novel shape-preserving, reaction-based processes for generating materials with tailored chemistries and macro-to-nanoscale structures for energy, environmental, transportation, defense, and medical applications.
