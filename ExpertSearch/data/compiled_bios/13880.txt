University of Science and Technology of China Research interests: Solid Mechanics Materials Engineering Thermophysics Machine Learning Soft Robotics Lab/Center Affiliation: Syracuse Biomaterials Institute Current Research: Shan Research Group (SRG) currently focuses on interdisciplinary research in Smart, Hybrid, Active and Nature-inspired Materials, Mechanics, and Machines (SHAN 3M). Fundamental insights from solid mechanics, materials engineering, thermal science, and machine learning are emphasized for the design and fabrication of soft multifunctional materials and high-performance robotic mechanisms, which impact critical application domains such as soft robotics, biomedical devices, and wearable devices. The ultimate goal of SRGs research is to improve human-machine-environment interactions.
