Weller Assistant Professor Home Find Faculty Daniel S. Weller Bio B.S. Carnegie Mellon University, 2006M.S. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2008Ph.D. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012Post-Doc University of Michigan, 2012-2014 "My research develops new ways to process image information, enhancing the quality and availability of state-of-the-art medical imaging." Daniel S. Weller, Assistant Professor Prior to joining UVA in 2014, Daniel Weller was a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, MI, where he worked on imaging research supported by a US National Institutes of Health Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award postdoctoral fellowship. He completed his SM and PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2008 and 2012 at MIT, in Cambridge, MA, preceded by completing his BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2006 at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. He serves as an associate editor for the IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and is a member of the Computational Imaging Technical Committee in the IEEE Signal Processing Society. He also served as a team leader for UVA CHARGE, an NSF ADVANCE program aimed at recruiting and retaining women faculty in STEM and SBE fields. He is a member of IEEE, ISMRM, Eta Kappa Nu, and Tau Beta Pi.

Google Scholar Courses Taught APMA 2501 Mathematics of Information Spring Semester ECE 6711 Probability and Stochastic Processes Fall Semester ECE 4750/6750 Digital Signal Processing Spring Semester ECE 7776 Advanced Digital Signal Processing Fall Semester Featured Grants & Projects NIH R56 EB028254 - Generalizing Deep Learning Reconstruction for Free-Breathing and Quantitative MRI The major goal of this project is to develop machine-learning methods for high-resolution, free-breathing quantitative MRI and apply it to T1 mapping of the myocardium to identify diffuse and focal scar and help differentiate among left ventricular hypertrophies. NSF 1759802 - ABI: Innovation: Analyzing Neuroglial Cell Dynamics in their Natural Environment with Video Microscopy The overall goal of this project is to produce modular, scalable, and open-source video processing and analysis software tools to advance neuroscientists' understanding of how neural and glial cells interaction with each other and with their environment. Read More NIH R01 HL147104 - Free-breathing and simultaneous multislice cine DENSE myocardial strain imaging Co-investigator (PI: Frederick H. Epstein) The major goal of this project is to develop cine DENSE into a cardiac MRI imaging method that retains high accuracy and reproducibility and is fast and easy-to-use.
