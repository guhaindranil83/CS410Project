Pure Mathematics & Mathematics Education Research Eric Bahuaud Fields of interest: Differential geometry, partial differential equations. Click here for a list of publications(Google Scholar) Jeff Boersema Fields of interest: Real C*-algebras and K-theory Click here for a list of publications Shusen Ding Fields of interest: Harmonic analysis and partial differential equations Dr. Dings research fields are harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Recently, he workson A-harmonic equations and Dirac-harmonic equations for differential forms and the theory of related operators, including the Dirac operator, Greens operator, potential operator and homotopy operator on differential forms. Click here for a list of publications Dylan Helliwell Fields of interest: Differential geometry Click here for a list of publications Allison Henrich Fields of interest: Knot theory Dr. Henrich's research is primarily in knot theory. She studies pseudoknots and virtual knots, among other generalizations of classical knots. She is also interested in questions related to unknots and unknotting operations as well as games involving knots. More detailed information about her research can be found on her webpage. Click here for a list of publications Jim Humphreys Fields of interest: Mathematical logic Click here for a list of publications Steve Klee Fields of interest: Algebraic and geometric combinatorics. Combinatorics of simplicial and cubical decompositions of polytopes and manifolds. Connections between combinatorics, commutative algebra, and algebraic topology. Click here for a list of publications Mark MacLean Fields of interest: Algebraic combinatorics. Dr. MacLean's main research interest is the study of distance-regular graphs. He often uses algebraic techniques to study these combinatorial objects. Click here for a list of publications David Neel Fields of interest: Graph Theory, Matroid Theory Leanne Roberston Fields of interest: Number theory AJ Stewart Fields of interest: Algebraic geometry Katya Yurasovskaya Fields of interest: Math education and low-dimensional topology Applied Mathematics & Statistics Research John Carter Fields of interest: Partial differential equations Dr. Carter's studies nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), with an emphasis on PDEs that model surface water waves. Hiswork currently focuses on effects such as dispersion, viscosity, surface tension and vorticity. Many of these effects require the use of nonlocal PDEs such as the Whitham, fractional KdV and Dysthe equations. Hisresearch interests include stability analysis, fast numerical methods for nonlinear evolution equations and mathematical physics. Click here for a list of publications Christine Cole Within the broad field of mathematical biology, Dr. Coles research interests lie in modeling cellular level biophysical phenomena. Her dissertation focused on mathematical models for molecular motors. The mathematical methods used in this field are drawn from a broad range of areas, including partial differential equations, stochastic processes, and dynamical systems. Click here for a list of publications Brian Fischer Fields of interest: Computational neuroscience Dr. Fischer's research is in computational neuroscience with a focus on sound localization. He uses statistical analyses of neural data to determine how sound is processed in the brain. He is also interested in how principles of Bayesian statistical inference describe brain function. Click here for a list of publications Katie Oliveras Fields of interest: Nonlinear waves My current research interests lie in the broad spectrum of integrable systems, and in particular, nonlinear waves. I am currently focusing on various aspects of solutions to Euler's equations for surface gravity-capillary waves using a nonlocal formulation of the water-wave problem due to Ablowitz, Fokas, and Musslimani. Click here for a list of publications McLean Sloughter Fields of interest: Statistical Forecasting, Environmental Modeling, Renewable Energy, Math Pedagogy Click here for a list of publications Donna Sylvester Dr. Sylvester's research interests focus on applications of partial differential equations to physical problems. This field draws heavily on ideas from analysis, differential equations, and linear algebra.
