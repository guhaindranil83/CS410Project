Schindler Daniel E. Schindler Daniel E. Schindler Professor deschind@u.washington.edu FSH (206) 616-6724 Accepting graduate students Fields of interest Conservation Biology, Ecology, Evolution & Systematics Research Biography Related news Relevant publications My research seeks to understand the causes and consequences of ecosystem dynamics. Of particular interest are (1) the effects of changing climate on trophic interactions and ecosystem services provided by aquatic ecosystems, (2) fisheries as large-scale drivers of ecosystem organization, (3) importance of anadromous fishes for linking marine ecosystems to coastal aquatic and riparian systems, and (4) the importance of aquatic-terrestrial coupling in ecosystem organization. My approach to research integrates field ecology with simulation and statistical modeling. I encourage collaborative research because I believe that the best science is accomplished by multi-investigator teams who can effectively address ecological problems at scales that are relevant to resource management and conservation. d conservation. 2003-present.
