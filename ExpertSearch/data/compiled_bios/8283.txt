Salapaka Professor phone: email: salapaka@illinois.edu For more information Research Website Education Ph.D. Mech. Eng. University of California, Santa Barbara 2002 M.S. Mech. Eng. University of California, Santa Barbara 1997 B.Tech Mech. Eng. Indian Institute of Technology 1995 Biography Srinivasa M. Salapaka received the B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology at Chennai in 1995, the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California at Santa Barbara, U.S.A in 1997 and 2002, respectively. During 2002-2004, he was a postdoctoral associate in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, USA. Since January 2004, he has been a Faculty Member in Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He got the NSF CAREER award in the year 2005. He is an ASME fellow since 2015. His areas of current research interest include controls for nano/bio technology, combinatorial optimization, Brownian ratchets, dynamic-systems analysis of numerical algorithms, and control of power systems. Academic Positions Associate Professor, Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, UIUC, 2010-2017 Department Affiliate (0%), Department of Aerospace Engineering, UIUC, October 16, 2008-date Member of Coordinated Science Laboratory (0%), August 16, 2007-date Department Affiliate (0%), Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, UIUC, Aug 16, 2006-date Assistant Professor, Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, UIUC, Jan. 1, 2004-2010 Postdoctoral Associate, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Summer 2002 - Fall 2003 Other Professional Employment Research/Teaching Assistant, University of California, Santa Barbara, Spring 1995 - 2002 Research Statement Professor Salapaka's research can be broadly divided into three areas - (I) one area is nano-biotechnology, where emphasis is on developing frameworks for modeling and analyzing systems at nanoscales, and, developing new instrumentation and methodologies for nano-investigation and nano-manipulation. In particular, his group has made significant contributions in modeling, analysis, and control, thereby enhancing and engendering new capabilities for precision positioning and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). He is leveraging the resulting control systems and instrumentation expertise toward scientific studies, especially studying intracellular protein (e.g. Kinesin and Dynein) motion. (II) Another broad area of his research is classification, clustering, and aggregation of large data sets, where he is developing frameworks for designing algorithms to efficiently solve the underlying combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, his research group is making significant contributions to drug-selection problems in combinatorial drug discovery, dynamic coverage problems in sensor networks, and coverage-cum-routing problems in flexible communication and transportation networks, dynamic network-reduction problems in neuroscience, and model reduction of large parametric models, aggregation of weighted directed graphs and Markov chains. Related optimization problems have non convex cost functions that are riddled with multiple local minima, and are proved to be computationally complex (NP-hard). (III) More recently he is working on power systems and control , where he is applying modern systems techniques for developing control of power-grid/ power electronics technologies. This research aims in comprehensive technology for developing and implementing smart-grid technologies capable of harnessing much more power from renewable (though) uncertain power sources while guaranteeing grid stability and satisfying economic power sharing constraints.
