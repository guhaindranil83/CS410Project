Brownis the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience at MIT; the Warren M. Zapol Professor of Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School; and a practicing anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. Professor Brown is an anesthesiologist-statistician whose experimental research has made important contributions to understanding how anesthetics act in the brain to create the states of general anesthesia. In his statistics research he has developed signal processing algorithms to study dynamic processes in neuroscience. Prof. Brown served on the NIH BRAIN Initiative Working Group. He is the recipient of an NIH Directors Pioneer Award, an NIH Directors Transformative Research Award, the Jerome Sacks Award from the National Institute of Statistical Science, the American Society of Anesthesiologists Excellence in Research Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship in Applied Mathematics. He is a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the IEEE, the American Academy of Arts Sciences and the National Academy of Inventors. Prof. Brown is a member of the National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Academy of Engineering.
