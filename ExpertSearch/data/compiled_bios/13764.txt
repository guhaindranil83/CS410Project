My research group works on robust diagnostics and control problems that involve using networked systems to facilitate the monitoring and control of large-scale critical infrastructures, including transportation, water, and energy distribution systems. We also study the effect of security attacks and random faults on the survivability of networked systems, and designs incentive-compatible control mechanisms to reduce network risks. Networked control systems: theory and algorithms Applied game theory Cyber-physical systems security Network economics: pricing and incentive regulation Teaching Interests 1.020 Principles of Energy and Water Sustainability Introduces a systems approach to modeling, analysis, and design of sustainable systems. Covers principles of dynamical systems, network models, optimization, and control, with applications in ecosystems, infrastructure networks, and energy systems. Includes a significant programming component. Students implement and analyze numerical models of systems, and make design decisions to balance physical, environmental, and economic considerations based on real and simulated data. 1.208 Resilient Infrastructure Networks Game-theoretic models and network optimization methods for improving resilience of large-scale infrastructure networks against security and reliability failures. Topics include: Network security games, interdiction models, strategic resource allocation and network design. Network equilibrium models, routing games, congestion pricing, and demand response. Cyber-physical security of control systems, fault and attack diagnostic tools, and resilient control. Design of operations management strategies for different reliability and security scenarios. Applications to transportation, logistics, electric-power, and water distribution networks. Awards and Honors IIT Roorkee Best B.Tech.
