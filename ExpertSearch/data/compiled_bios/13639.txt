He works at the forefront of research into the development and application of computer models for analyzing the sustainability of groundwater resources, contaminant fate and transport, nuclear waste isolation, and climate change impacts. He has been collaborating with industry and government sectors for over 20 years solving challenging groundwater problems. Tools such as GIS (Geographic Information Systems), environmental databases, multi-dimensional scientific visualization, and HPC (High Performance Computing) are applied in combination with advanced multi-physics computational models for simulating coupled density-dependent groundwater flow, solute transport, hydro-mechanics, and multi-phase flow in porous and fractured media. Currently, Dr. Normani and his team are focusing on the characterization of sedimentary and fractured crystalline rock settings in Canada for radioactive waste isolation and the assessment of geosphere stability over time scales which include the growth and retreat of continental scale ice-sheets.Research InterestsDevelopment and application of advanced multi-physics computational models for simulating groundwater flow and transport in porous and fractured media.Developing techniques and tools for coupling hydrological, groundwater, water quality, engineering, and meteorological models.Paleohydrogeological modelling of the impact of continental ice-sheets on pore fluid migration at depth in both sedimentary and crystalline rock settings.Development and implementation of sensitivity, uncertainty and calibration methods to the modelling of environmental systems.Application of High Performance Computing (HPC) to environmental modelling from the micro to the macro scale and advanced scientific visualization of complex environmental datasets.Education2009, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo1998, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Waterloo1995, Bachelor of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of WaterlooSelected/Recent PublicationsYin, Yong and Sykes, Jonathan F and Normani, Stefano D, Impacts of spatial and temporal recharge on field-scale contaminant transport model calibration, Journal of Hydrology, 527, 2015, 77 - 87Fischer, Urs H and Bebiolka, Anke and Brandefelt, Jenny and Follin, Sven and Hirschorn, Sarah and Jensen, Mark and Keller, Siegfried and Kennel lL, Nslund JO and Normani, S and Selroos, JO and others, Radioactive waste under conditions of future ice ages, Snow and Ice-related Hazards, Risks and Disasters, Haeberli W, Whiteman C (eds).

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
