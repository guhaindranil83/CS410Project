Faculty Guido Gerig Department Chair and Institute Professor of Computer Science and Engineering Professor of Biomedical Engineering Computer Science and Engineering Biomedical Engineering Connect Guido Gerig is Department Chair and Institute Professor at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He also holds associated/affiliated appointments at NYU Courant CS, NYU Langone Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychiatry and Radiology. Guido Gerig has been named IEEE Fellow (class of 2019) and has also been appointed as a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) in 2010. Starting image analysis with applications to satellite imaging, he became increasingly interested in driving problems from medicine, tackled in close multidisciplinary collaboration between medicine, engineering, and statistics. His research supports a number of clinical imaging research studies with novel, innovative image analysis methodologies related to segmentation, registration, atlas building, shape analysis, and image statistics. Driving clinical problems include research in autism, Down's syncdrome, eye diseases (Glaucoma, AMD), multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, studies of infants at risk for mental illness, and in general analysis of anatomical changes from normal due to disease, therapy and recovery. Gerig's research resulted in various new image analysis methodologies for nonlinear processing, multi-scale segmentation and shape analysis, some of them first and seminal to the field. Applications resulted in new clinical research discoveries such as vulnerability for schizophrenia, early diagnosis of autism based on differences in brain development trajectories, and correlation of shape atrophy with risk status in Huntington's. New tools and methods are developed as open source software and made available to the public, including teaching materials and hands-on training workshops. Guido Gerig was previously USTAR Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah (2007-2015) establishing the Utah Center for Neuroimage Analysis (UCNIA), Taylor Grandy Professor of Computer Science and Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1998-2007) launching the UNC Neuro Image Research and Analysis Laboratories (NIRAL), and Assistant Professor at ETH Zurich (1993-1998). Gerig holds several awards from Utah and UNC for Excellence in Teaching. http://library.med.nyu.edu/api/publications?person=gg87 http://www.sci.utah.edu/scipubs/search.html?schTerm=G.+Gerig Research Interests: Image Processing & Analysis Medical Image Processing 3D Computer Vision Shape Analysis Spatiotemporal Modeling Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Education Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH-Z)1981 MSc, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH-Z)1987 PhD, Experience University of Utah USTAR Professor From: July 2007 to June 2015 University of North Carolina UNC Taylor Grandy Professor From: July 1998 to June 2007 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ETH Assistant Professor From: July 1993 to June 1998 Publications Journal and Conference Articles (peer reviewed) NIH Pubmed/PMC list of publications: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Gerig%20G NYU Health Science Library: http://library.med.nyu.edu/api/publications?person=gg87 Affiliations NYU Courant Institute, Computer Science NYU Radiology, Center for Biomedical Imaging NYU Child and Adolescence Psychiatry Awards 2019: IEEE Fellow (class of 2019) 2010: Elected Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) 2010 Dean's letter University of Utah for Excellence in Teaching 2009: Fellow of the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Society 2009: ISMRM (Int Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine): Outstanding Teacher Award 2006, 2004, 1999: Student Teaching Awards, UNC Chapel Hill, Dept.
