Hadley Cocks Professor with Tenure in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science Professor Cocks' recent research has ranged over a wide variety of areas in materials science, including crystal growth, mechanical properties of kidney stones, lunar science, diffraction optics, materials for radiation detection, and radiation shielding. For many years he was a consultant to Los Alamos National Laboratories. His current interests include magnesium alloy development and the the development of an ultrasensitive neutron detector, which is being supported by the Department of Homeland Security. His research has been supported by NSF, NIH, AFOSR, DOE, NREL (formerly the Solar Energy Research Institute) as well as DHS, the American Cancer Society, and the North Carolina Space Grand Consortium. Professor Cocks' recent book, Energy Demand and Climate Change: Issues and Resolutions, is a popular, scientifically sound yet easily read book providing the science and background necessary to understand today's energy and climate problems, and offers possible answers using both current and future technology.
