Melanie Campbell Professor Dr. Campbellleads a highly multidisciplinary research group where theystudy ocular development, eye disease, and linear and non-linear optics of the eye. Theyinvestigate the fundamental refractive properties of the eye's components to improve diagnosis and therapy for various ocular conditions. Bae-Yeun Ha Professor; Undergraduate Advisor - Life Physics In Professor Ha's research group, theyexplore a few theoretical problems in soft matter and biophysics, namely, chromosomes in living cells and lipid bilayer membranes. Zoya Leonenko Professor Dr.Leonenko leads a nanoscale biophysics research group which uses advanced scanning probe microscopy methods to study biophysics of lipids and lipid-protein interactions, interactions of nanoparticles with lipid membrane and monolayers, and to develop novel application of lipid films in biomedical nanotechnology and biosensing. Qing-Bin Lu Professor; University Research Chair; Undergraduate Advisor - Chemical Physics Professor Lus research programs cross disciplines in physics, chemistry, environment, climate, biology and medicine, particularly focusing on femtomedicine and cancer therapy, as well as the sciences of atmospheric ozone depletion (the ozone hole) and global climate change (global warming).

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
