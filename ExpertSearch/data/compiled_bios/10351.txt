He is also interested in applying these models in challenging robotics tasks, to better understand how the brain deals with the complex physical world. Recent progress in his lab includes: The first deep-network architecture that is based quantitatively on a large cortical network (Tripp, 2019); the most comprehensive model of a higher cortical representation (Rezai et al., 2018); the largest dataset of human-demonstrated robotic grasps (Iyegar et al., 2018); the only robotic head that has movement capabilities on par with humans (including saccade velocity, stereo baseline, and range of motion) (Huber et al., 2018); and the first spiking neural network model of the planning of complex actions (Blouw et al., 2016).Research InterestsComputational neuroscienceDeep learningRoboticsCourses*SYDE 202 - SeminarTaught in 2015SYDE 544 - Biomedical Measurement and Signal ProcessingTaught in 2015, 2016SYDE 750 - Topics in Systems ModellingTaught in 2015, 2016BME 201 - SeminarTaught in 2016, 2019SYDE 552 - Computational NeuroscienceTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018BME 261 - Prototyping, Simulation and DesignTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018BME 301 - SeminarTaught in 2018BME 355 - Anatomical Systems ModellingTaught in 2017, 2018SYDE 770 - Selected Topics in Communication and Information SystemsTaught in 2017, 2018SYDE 113 - Matrices and Linear SystemsTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsTripp, BP, Approximating the Architecture of Visual Cortex in a Convolutional Network, Neural Computation, 31(8), 2019, 1551 - 1591LinkOmid Rezai, Pinar Boyraz Jentsch, Bryan Tripp, A video-driven model of response statistics in the primate middle temporal area, Neural Networks, 108, 2018, 424 - 444LinkHuber, Scott and Selby, Ben and Tripp, Bryan, OREO: An open-hardware robotic head that supports practical saccades and accommodation,, IEEE Robotics Automation Letters, 3(3), 2018, 2640 - 2645LinkSelby, Ben and Tripp, Bryan, Extending the Stabilized Supralinear Network model of V1 for binocular image processing, 2017, Neural Networks 90: 29-41.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
