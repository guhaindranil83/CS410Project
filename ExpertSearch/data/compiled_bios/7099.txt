Dr. Chang devoted a total of 23 years of service to R&D at Bell Systems-Bell Labs, Bellcore, and Telcordia Technologies-where he served in various management positions including Director of Optical System Integration and Network Interoperability Group, and finally, Director and Chief Scientist of Optical Internet Research. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, he served as Vice President and Chief Technology Strategist of OpNext, Inc., where he was in charge of technology planning and product strategy for high-speed optical networking components and systems. Professor Chang has been granted 55 patents and co-authored more than 300 peer-reviewed journal and conference papers in the areas of optoelectronic devices, high speed integrated circuits, telecommunication switching components and systems, WDM optical networking systems and networks, optical network security, optical label switching and optical interconnect technologies, TDM- and WDM-PONs, and radio-over-fiber and wireless-over-fiber systems and networks. He has been an active contributor to many IEEE Photonics Society and Optical Society of America (OSA) sponsored journals, conferences, and committees. He has served five times as the lead guest editor for special issues of the Journal of Lightwave Technology (JLT) and Journal of Optical Communications and Networking (JOCN), sponsored by IEEE and/or OSA. The special issues include: Optical Networks published in 2000 by JLT, Metro and Access Networks published in 2004 by JLT, Convergence of Optical Wireless Access Network in 2007 by JLT, Radio-over-Optical Fiber Networks in 2008 by JOCN, and the most recent one on Very High Throughput Wireless over Fiber Technologies and Applications in 2010 by JLT. He is a pioneer and champion of broadband wireless over fiber technologies for convergence of wireless and optical access networks that provides high bandwidth, high capacity, and mobile access to future Internet users.
