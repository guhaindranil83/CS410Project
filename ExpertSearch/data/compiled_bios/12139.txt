He is the site director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), Industry-University Cooperative Research Center on Cloud and Autonomic Computing regarding the design and development of architectures for achieving self-management capabilities across the layers of cloud computing systems. His research program covers high performance, domain-specific and non-traditional computing architectures areas focusing on: (1) resource management strategies from distributed computing to System-on-Chip (SoC) scale, (2) parallel computing for bridging the gap between the domain scientist, programming environment and emerging hardware architectures, (3) reconfigurable architectures for neuromorphic computing. Akoglu has been involved in many interdisciplinary collaborative projects with the goal of solving the challenges of bridging the gap between the domain scientist, programming environment and emerging highly parallel hardware architectures. His research program has been funded by the National Science Foundation, iPlant Collaborative, U.S. Air Force, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratories, Office of Naval Researchand the Army Battle Command Battle Laboratory.
