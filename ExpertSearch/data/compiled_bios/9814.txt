My primary work takes place at the Institute for Modeling Plasmas, Atmospheres, and Cosmic DusT (IMPACT, http://impact.colorado.edu ), where we have several parallel experimental and modeling efforts related to plasma/surface interactions at airless bodies, the evolution of planetary surfaces, the dynamics of cosmic dust, the physics of hypervelocity impacts... tobin.munsat@colorado.edu (303) 735-5596 Jeanne Nijhowne Graduate Program Assistant Physics Department contact for the graduate program and graduate faculty appointments. jeanne.nijhowne@colorado.edu (303) 735-0519 Michael Ritzwoller Professor Chair Director - Center for Imaging the Earth's Interior (CIEI) Physics Research Interests: Professor Ritzwoller is an observational seismologist. His early work was mainly in normal mode seismology and helioseismology. Research in the last decade has concentrated on developing methods to focus seismic models derived from surface wave dispersion information to tectonic scales, particularly in the US and China. Recent emphasis has focused on developing methods for exploiting ambient noise and earthquakes in surface wave tomography and combining this information to... michael.ritzwoller@colorado.edu Chair's Office: (303) 492-0297 Faculty Office: (303) 492-7075 Lindsey Romero Front Desk Coordinator Physics Main contact for the physics front office, room calendar scheduling, building proctor, key/swipe card liaison and room access, scheduling for Chairs appointments, textbook submission and desk copy ordering, colloquium coordinator, Commons and Reading Room rentals, backup for undergraduate program assistant Lindsey.Romero@colorado.edu (303) 492-6952 Heather Lewandowski Professor Associate Chair - Engineering Physics EPEN Faculty Advisor (Student's Last Name: Q-Z) Physics Office Hours: Friday 3:00pm - 5:00pm Visit Buff Portal Advising for Zoom link Research Interests: My group studies collisions and reactions of simple cold molecules. Our ultimate goal is to understand the quantum mechanical processes involved in making and breaking a chemical bond. We aim to control the reacting molecules external and internal degrees of freedom in the quantum regime. To accomplish this control, we slow down a... lewandoh@colorado.edu (303) 492-1446 Sherry Namburi Manager - Department Finance and Operations Physics Assistant to Chair, payroll liaison for Classified Staff, liaison to A & S for Faculty, Parking, P-Card Approver, Department budget and expenditures. sherry.namburi@colorado.edu (303) 492-8703 Faculty Affiliate Faculty Staff Advisors and Mentors Department Administration Emeriti Want to make an appointment with our Department Chair?
