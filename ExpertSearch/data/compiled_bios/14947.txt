Given this reality, we believe that students who major in mathematics at Seattle University need to engage, deeply, with the fertile creative side of mathematics, else their understanding of this venerable and complex human way of knowing would be incomplete. One way we help students immerse themselves in this way is by mentoring them in undergraduate research, exploring questions at and even beyond the boundaries of what is mathematically known. Using the navigation links at left, you can find titles and brief descriptions of some of the forms that past such explorations have taken. In some cases, you can find links to published work. New Faculty Research Mathematical Biosciences & Engineering Volume 15, Number 4, August 2018, pp. 841-862 Continuous & Pulsed Epidemiological Models for Onchocerciasis with Implications for Eradication Strategy Authors: Glenn Ledder, Donna Sylvester, Rachelle R. Bouchat, Johann A. Thiel Abstract: Onchocerciasis is an endemic disease in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Complex mathematical models are being used to assess the likely efficacy of efforts to eradicate the disease; however, their predictions have not always been borne out in practice. In this paper, we represent the immunological aspects of the disease with a single empirical parameter in order to reduce the model complexity. doi:10.3934/mbe.2018038 Mathematics Department 901 12th Ave., BANN 415 Seattle, WA 98122 (206) 296-5930 teegardj@seattleu.edu seattleu.edu People StudentsFaculty and StaffAlumniParents Essentials Online ProgramsDirectoriesGiveMySU Visit Campus ToursLibraryCampus MapGetting to SU Follow Us Apply Now Contact Careers Request Info Terms of Service Privacy PolicyEthics Line Website Feedback Sitemap Seattle University
