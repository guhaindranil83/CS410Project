Their group is closely involved in synthesis of metal-oxide thin films with atomic scale control over structure and composition and understanding ionic and electronic transport in strong electric fields. They are particularly interested in oxides where Coulomb interactions lead to new phases that allow unprecedented properties to emerge. Another area of long standing interest is solid oxide fuel cells utilizing ultra-thin suspended oxide membranes. The group is highly multi-disciplinary, involving physicists, materials scientists and electrical engineers, all having a common underlying interest in uncovering properties of new materials. They collaborate extensively with researchers in academia, industry and national labs. Alumni from the group have moved on to faculty positions at major research institutions; national/industrial/defense research laboratories, or have started companies, indicating diverse opportunities in their chosen fields. Presently, the group is working on: Metal-insulator transitions and physical intelligence Ultra-thin solid oxide fuel cells Materials discovery in extreme environments Graduate Students Michael Taejoon Park Our People MSE Directory Faculty Staff Business Office Staff Faculty Emeriti Courtesy Appointments Adjunct Faculty Graduate Students Research Staff Post-Doctoral Research Staff Alumni Information Faculty Books Published Discover Students Online Faculty Alumni Partners Explore Campus Map Facts & Figures Schools News & Events Visit Us Connect Employment Engineering Computer Network Intranet Brightspace myPurdue People Engineering Directory Contact Us Social Media Media Contacts Purdue Directory Follow Purdue University, 610 Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, 765-494-4600 2020 Purdue University | An equal access/equal opportunity university | Integrity Statement | Copyright Complaints | Brand Toolkit | Maintained by the Engineering Computer Network Contact Office of Marketing and Media for accessibility issues with this page | Accessibility Resources | Contact Us | Email webmaster-mse@ecn.purdue.edu to report a problem
