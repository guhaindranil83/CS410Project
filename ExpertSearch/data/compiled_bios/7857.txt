Prior to joining Rensselaer, he spent two years in North Carolina State University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. Dr. Shi aims to understand complex material behaviors and design better materials using simulation and modeling. His research include many material systems: metallic/silica/polymeric glasses/composites, nanostructured carbon, on material behaviors such as fracture, self-assembly, wetting and friction/wear. He was selected as one of the inaugural Gordon S. Fulcher Distinguished Researchers by Corning Inc, where he spent sabbatical in 2015.
