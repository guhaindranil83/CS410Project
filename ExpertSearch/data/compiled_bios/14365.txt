People Dr John O'Hara People Dr John O'Hara Senior Lecturer School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email johara@essex.ac.uk Location 1NW.3.19, Colchester Campus Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Biography I was an undergraduate pure mathematics major at the New University of Ulster. I completed my PGCE (in Education) and MSc (in probability theory) at Queens University, Belfast. My PhD was in theory of differential equations, completed at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg South Africa. Before coming to the University of Essex (2010-present) I worked in a number of universities in Southern Africa. I am the Director of CCFEA (Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents in the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering). I am also responsible for PhD admissions within the Centre. I am a member of the London Mathematical Society. Qualifications PhD University of the Witwatersrand, (1991) MSc Queen's University Belfast, (1981) PGCE Queen's University Belfast, (1977) BSc University of Ulster, (1976) Appointments University of Essex Deputy Director, CSEE, CCFEA (1/1/2010 - 1/10/2019) Director, CCFEA, University of Essex (1/10/2019 - present) Research and professional activities Current research Using stochastic differential equations in finance. In this project we use Lie symmetry methods to find solutions to stochastic differential equations. Starting with a stochastic version of the Black-Scholes-Merton equation we calculate the symmetries of the equation, infinitesimal operators, group invariance and a solution. These ideas are applied to other equations in the debt market. More information about this project Use deep neural networks and other machine learning methodologies for financial time series analysis. We use current advances in financial time series analysis and deep learning. In particular, applying LSTM for sequence learning. Using directional changes for searching Head and Shoulder patterns Using a directional change approach to describe the behaviour of the financial markets.
