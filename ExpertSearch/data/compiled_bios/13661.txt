He currently specializes in Computational Tools for Asset & Project Management. Professor Hegazi is looking to utilize recent advances in computational tools that are able to optimize construction operations, improve work productivity, and solve complex problems. Along with this focus is the simplification of the underlying advanced concepts through the use of customary computer platforms, such as spreadsheets, to broaden the applicability of such concepts in the industry. The main directions are: Intelligent decision support systems for applications characterized by high uncertainty and risk; Integration and optimization of techniques for time, cost, and quality control; Developing computerized models such as asset management systems, discrete-event simulation, design, construction, coordination, estimating, bidding, corrective actions, project control, forecasting, and productivity enhancement. As a result of his work, Professor Hegazi has received numerous research excellence honours and awards. In 2004, he was acknowledged as one of the worlds top 5 contributing authors to ASCE construction research, as reported in the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management article, Vol. 130, No. 3. Professor Hegazi holds 2 patents, a 2011 Best Paper award from the Journal of Management in Engineering-ASCE, and Top Cited Paper award from the Advanced Engineering Informatics Journal. He has consulted and advised a number of contractors and government organizations in Canada and is also the founder of OPTEAM Project Management Consultants Inc. In addition, Professor Hegazi is the author of the textbook "Computer-Based Construction Project Management" published by Prentice Hall.Research InterestsStructuresMechanics & ConstructionAsset ManagementPlanning and SchedulingProject ControlOptimizationProject ManagementGeographic Information SystemsComputer ApplicationsEvolutionary AlgorithmsDecision Support SystemsEconomics of Infrastructure StabilityPPPbudgeting and backlogApplication of Neural NetworksGenetic AlgorithmsFuzzy LogicEducation1993, Doctorate, Construction Management (Building Studies), Concordia University1986, Master's, Civil Engineering, University of Michigan1981, Bachelor's, Civil Engineering, Ain Shams University, Civil Engineering DepartmentCourses*CIVE 205 - Solid Mechanics 2Taught in 2015CIVE 401 - Civil Engineering Design Project 2Taught in 2017CIVE 400 - Civil Engineering Design Project 1Taught in 2017CIVE 596 - Construction EngineeringTaught in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019CIVE 710 - Advanced Project ManagementTaught in 2016, 2018CIVE 711 - Computer-Aided Project Organization and ManagementTaught in 2015, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsAbuwarda, Zinab and Hegazy, Tarek, Work-Package Planning and Schedule Optimization for Projects with Evolving Constraints, Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 2016Rashedi, Roozbeh and Hegazy, Tarek, Strategic policy analysis for infrastructure rehabilitation using system dynamics, Structure and Infrastructure Engineering, 12(6), 2016, 667 - 681Rashedi, Roozbeh and Hegazy, Tarek, Examining budget policies for new and existing facilities: a system dynamics approach, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 43(999), 2016, 511 - 522Abuwarda, Zinab and Hegazy, Tarek, Flexible Activity Relations to Support Optimum Schedule Acceleration, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 2016Abdel-Monem, Mohamed and Abuwarda, Zinab and Hegazy, Tarek, Progress tracking of multiple projects using email and voice, , 2015 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
