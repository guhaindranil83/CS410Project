Her research since the mid 1990s has been focused on the lower three layers of MIMO wireless networks that have virtual or distributed antenna arrays, with emphasis on wireless LAN, ad hoc, mesh, and sensor networks. She established the Smart Antenna Research Laboratory, which performs both experimental and theoretical studies. Recent SARL activities include synchronization for distributed or virtual arrays, nonlinear precoding and interference alignment for wireless LANs with distributed MIMO access points, modeling the residual from interference cancelation, distributed array-based network time synchronization, and millimeter wave communications. Most protocols are demonstrated on a 20-node network of software defined radios (SDRs) in practical environments and topologies. Research interests: Wireless communication Cooperative diversity Distributed MIMO MAC and routing for wireless multi-hop ad hoc and sensor networks Network time synchronization for multi-hop networks Millimeter wave communications Distinctions: The 2017 Vivian A.
