We pay particular attention to recombination as a fundamental parameter in the evolution of genes, genomes and, ultimately, species. We study the molecular causes and evolutionary consequences of recombination variation. To this end we apply an interdisciplinary approach using population genetics, bioinformatics, computer simulations, traditional genetics, and next-generation sequencing techniques to study genomes and transcriptomes. We take full advantage of the unparalleled genetic and genomic tools available in the Drosophila model system.
