When birds encounter heavy metals in their environment, part of their physiological detoxification process is to excrete those metals as they form their eggs or feathers. Therefore, museums house a valuable but largely untapped historical record of environmental contaminants at the time specimens were collected. The Jurica-Suchy Nature museum has an extensive collection of eggs and bird pelts collected as early as the mid-nineteenth century through the 1940's. Research this summer will focus on sorting through published data and the museum specimens to prioritize appropriate specimens for non-destructive metal testing using the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. When time is assigned at the APS, students will assist in collection of data and then subsequent analyses.
