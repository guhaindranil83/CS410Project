He attended graduate school at Rice University, receiving the M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 2002 and 2007, respectively. Following graduate school, he joined the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at the University of California, Berkeley as a postdoctoral research fellow in 2007. He joined the Georgia Tech faculty in July 2008, where he is affiliated with the Center for Signal and Information Processing. Dr. Rozell's research interests focus on the intersection of computational neuroscience and signal processing. One branch of this work aims to understand how neural systems organize and process sensory information, drawing on modern engineering ideas to develop improved data analysis tools and theoretical models. The other branch of this work uses recent insight into neural information processing to develop new and efficient approaches to difficult data analysis tasks. Research interests: Biological and computational vision Theoretical and computational neuroscience High-dimensional data analysis Distributed computing in novel architectures Applications in imaging, remote sensing, and biotechnology Distinctions: Demetrius T.
