Bostwick joined the department in 2016 following appointments as Golovin Assistant Professor at Northwestern University and postdoc researcher at NC State University. His research addresses fundamental problems in fluid transport with an emphasis on wetting and the interactions with soft substrates. More broadly, he is interested in pattern formation on both liquid interfaces and biological membranes. He is attracted to such problems because it is often possible to elucidate the underlying physics using simple models to compare to experiments.
