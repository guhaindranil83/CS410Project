Research in our laboratory seeks to understand the roles of glial cells in mammalian brain development and response to neural injury. Current projects are focused on identifying how specific purinergic signaling pathways regulate microglial cell activation, survival, and mobilization. To address these questions, we utilize confocal and multiphoton imaging methodology in combination with pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Models of brain injury include ischemic stroke and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in ex vivo cell culture and tissue slice preparations, and in intact brain in vivo.
