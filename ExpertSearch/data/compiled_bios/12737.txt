Weiss Carnegie Mellon University 3113 Newell-Simon Hall Pittsburgh, PA 15213 lew@cs.cmu.edu Professor Emeritus The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University Courtesy Appointments: Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering Education Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 1984 M.S. in Bioengineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 1976 B.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, 1972 Industry Positions Biomedical Engineer, ARCO Medical Products Company (1976-1979) Electrical Engineer, Fischback and Moore (1973-1974) Lee Weiss was a founding member of Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute. In the early years of the Institute his research focused on visual servo control of robots, flexible manufacturing systems, and micro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS). He then went on to pioneer numerous methodologies and systems for additive manufacturing. However, he always went back to his roots in bioengineering, and over the last 45 years he has sought to apply his diverse background to create technology-based solutions to address challenging problems in translational clinical medicine, including development of devices for interventional radiology, fetal heart monitoring, cardiac pacing, angioplasty, MEMS-based drug delivery, and computer-aided surgery. And, for the past 25 years until present, his research has focused on the biological foundations for and translational aspects of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. He holds 37 issued U.S. patents, has 161 peer-reviewed publications, and founded several biomedical start-up companies.
