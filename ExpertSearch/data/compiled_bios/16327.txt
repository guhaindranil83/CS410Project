Statistical challenges in astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology (i.e., astrostatistics) are a primary focus of my work. My exoplanet astronomy research focuses on the detection of low-mass exoplanets (e.g., Earth analogs) using the radial velocity method amid stellar activity. This is challenging because stellar activity can hide exoplanet signals or mimic an exoplanet signal leading to false detections. Keywords: astrostatistics, data science, topological data analysis, persistent homology, approximate Bayesian computation, visualization, and interdisciplinary research.
