He specializes in philosophy of language, philosophical logic, and metaphysics and epistemology. He attended Hamilton College, the University of Freiburg in West Germany and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Richard has published several books (Propositional Attitudes [1990], Meaning [2002], and When Truth Gives Out [2008]) and numerous articles, some of which are collected in the forthcoming collection of his papers Meaning in Context.Richard's current research interests include foundational issues in semantics (including the question of whether the semantics of discursive talk is invariably to be given by characterizing its truth conditions), the semantics of particular constructions (including the tenses and epistemic modals), vagueness, and issues on the borderline between epistemology and metaethics (for example, the conditions under which awareness of disagreement about normative matters should reduce one's confidence in one's normative beliefs). Richard is an avid hiker, an adequate cook of Mexican and Thai food, and a mediocre woodworker.For downloadable copies of some of his work in progress and recent publications, please visit his personal website.
