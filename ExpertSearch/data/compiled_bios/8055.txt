Physics, MIT, Cambridge, MAResearch InterestsHaptics; surface haptics; human-machine interaction; perception; cobotsProfessor Colgate's principal research interest is human-robot interaction. He has worked extensively in the areas of haptic (touch) interface, remote manipulation, and advanced prosthetics.He, along with collaborator Michael Peshkin, is the inventor of a broad class of collaborative robots known as cobots. In recent years, Professor Colgates research has focused on bringing haptic feedback to touch-based interfaces such as touch screens and touch pads.Significant RecognitionBest Paper Award, CHI 2011 for Enhancing Physicality in Touch Interaction with Programmable Friction by Vincent Lvesque, Louise Oram, Karon MacLean, Andy Cockburn, Nicolas D.

Edward, UltraShiver, IEEE Transactions on HapticsIn the Classroom Professor Colgate led a team of faculty from two of Northwestern's largest schools (McCormick and Weinberg) in the development of an ambitious freshman program called "Design Thinking and Communication" (DTC). DTC introduces students to a user-oriented process of engineering design, and it teaches design and technical communication in a highly integrated fashion. DTC is project-based, drawing clients from the university, local community, and local industry. It is a required course for all engineers at Northwestern. Prof. Colgate and Prof. Donald A. Norman (emeritus) served as the founding co-directors of Northwestern's Segal Design Institute. Among other activities, the Segal Design Institute offers a Master of Science degree in Engineering Design and Innovation, a certificate in Engineering Design, and a bachelor's in Manufacturing and Design Engineering (MaDE). Colgate also teaches ME 390, Introduction to Dynamic Systems.
