Following two years as a Research Fellow at Georgia Tech, he joined the University of Cincinnati (UC) in 2017 as an Assistant Professor of Aerospace Engineering. More detailed information is on Dr. Khare's research website: http://khare.uc.edu. Research. Dr. Khares research focuses on multiphase flows, non-reacting and reacting fluid dynamics, combustion systems, data analytics and high-performance computing relevant to energy, propulsion, and environmental applications. He addresses the fundamental physics (and chemistry) underlying various physical processes by conducting massively parallel high-fidelity numerical simulations (direct numerical simulations (DNS)/large eddy simulation (LES)) and develops physics-based models using theoretical analyses combined with big-data analytics, which are leveraged for accurate and efficient engineering design and analysis.
