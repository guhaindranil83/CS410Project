His studies were focused on multicomponent polymerization kinetics and modelling. His industrial experience includes work with Polysar on ionic polymerizations, the Uniroyal Chemical Co. modelling emulsion copolymerization, and ICI Worldwide studying high temperature polymerizations. He joined the faculty at the University of Ottawa in 1996 and was Department Chair from 2006 to 2011. Dr. Dub's expertise lies in polymer reaction engineering applied to kinetics, polymer characterization, modeling, and process monitoring for multicomponent bulk, solution and emulsion polymer systems. Recent applications of his work have been in the area of polymers from renewable materials and sustainable polymer production methods for pressure sensitive adhesives. In his spare time, Professor Dub plays ice hockey.
