His research interests focus on developing improved tools for computational modeling of complex nuclear energy systems, with applications in radiation shielding, nuclear waste management, nuclear non-proliferation and energy policy. Paul joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an assistant professor in August 2001 as part of theEnergy Systems and Policy Hiring Initiative. Paul currently serves as the Chair of theEnergy Analysis and Policy Graduate Certificateand on the Governance Committee of theNelson Institutefor Environmental Studies. In addition to the research pursued by hisComputational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG), Paul has served in a number of advisory and consultant roles. From 2001-2003, he was a member of the U.S. Department of Energys Generation IV Technology Roadmap Committee. In 2010, he was engaged as a consultant to the CEA Saclay, ERC Petten, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and theBlue Ribbon Commission on Americas Nuclear Energy Future. Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada, Paul specialized in the Nuclear Power option of theEngineering Science programat theUniversity of Toronto. After receiving his Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science, he began his graduate schooling in nuclear engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After three years, he moved to Karlsruhe, Germany, where he studied in the Institute for Neutron Physics and Reactor Engineering (of theKarlsruhe Institute of Technology), earning his Dr.-Ing. degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1998. Returning to Madison, Paul completed his Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering in 1999. Paul was the founding President of theNorth American Young Generation in Nuclear [NA-YGN], an organization created to provide unique opportunities to young professionals in all fields of nuclear science & technology. Paul has been active in theAmerican Nuclear Societyfor over 15 years, including membership in various committees and chairing the Student Sections Committee and the Special Committee on Electronic Communications and Publications. Paul also represented the ANS and NA-YGN at theinternational climate change negotiationsin Buenos Aires, Argentina (1998), and Bonn, Germany (1999). He is a member of the American and Canadian Nuclear Societies, the American Society for Engineering Education and the NA-YGN. Paul is married and has two daughters. They enjoy biking around Madisons paths and spending time outside.
