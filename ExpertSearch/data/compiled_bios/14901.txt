She earned her Ph.D. in Biochemistry Cell and Developmental Biology from Emory University where she studied transcriptional regulation at the nuclear pore complex. During postdoctoral work as an NIH IRACDA Fellow at Emory University, she investigated the reprogramming of histone modification-mediated transcriptional memory at fertilization. At Georgia Tech, Shana teaches in the introductory biology sequences, in the TA development and pedagogy course, and a variety of upper level core and elective Biology courses. She is also the Director of Advising in the School of Biological Sciences and aBiology undergraduate academic advisor. Her current research interests include the impact of active learning approaches on student learning in science content and process skills, retention in science fields, and attitudes toward science.
