He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine of the NAS and is a full member of the International Academy of Astronautics. Dr. Young joined the MIT faculty in 1962, and co-founded the Man-Vehicle Laboratory which does research on the visual and vestibular systems, visual-vestibular interaction, flight simulation, space motion sickness and manual control and displays. Following two years of training at Johnson Space Center he served as Alternate Payload Specialist during the October 1993 mission. Dr. Young has served on numerous Academy committees including the Committee on the Space Station, Committee on Human Factors, Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board, and Air Force Studies Board. He currently chairs NASAs Innovative Advanced Concepts External Council. degrees ScD in Instrumentation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1962 SM in Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1959 Certif de License in Mathematics, Faculte des Sciences, University of Paris, 1958 SB in Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1957 AB in Physics, Amherst College, 1957 selected awards/societies Fellow, American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, 2006 Koetser Foundation Prize, 1998 NASA Space Acts Award, 1995 Institute of Medicine, 1992 National Academy of Engineering, 1980 Aerospace Medical Association American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Dryden Lecturer in Research Barany Society Biomedical Engineering Society (President, ALZA Lecturer) Explorers Club Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) International Academy of Astronautics National Space Biomedical Research Institute Pioneer Award Society for Neuroscience research Professor Youngs contributions to the aerospace medical field have been in instrumentation (eye movement measurement) and basic and applied research in the field of vestibular function. His psychophysical work on semicircular canal and otolith function led to models that are applied to flight simulator motion control and are being extended to include visually induced motion effects. Professor Young is also recognized for his leadership in the aerospace human factors including applications of manual control theory, and especially for his research on adaptive manual control. His work on the vestibular system has led to his role as principal investigator for experiments on vestibular adaptation to weightlessness conducted aboard five Spacelab missions for which he received NASAs Public Service Group Achievement Award. selected publications T.
