My statistical methodological research concerns developing statistical methodology for analyzing spatially referenced data (spatial statistics) and spatial data repeatedly sampled over time (spatio-temporal statistics) that arise in the biological, physical, and social sciences. My collaborative research concerns applying modern statistical methods, especially spatial and spatio-temporal statistics, to studies of agricultural, biological, ecological, environmental, health, and social systems conducted by research scientists. To a large extent, my overall research program involves a close connection between the two types of research activities. Problems in my collaborative research that do not have adequate statistical tools motivate my statistical methodological research, whereas the new methods I develop in statistical methodological research are applied in my collaborative projects.
