With COVID-19, the volume of information that the Internet needs to carry has drastically increased. To be able to keep up with the user needs and enable new forms of online interaction, new ways to be able to transmit more information over existing infrastructure are needed. In collaboration with groups at the University of Pennsylvania and Duke University, Jornet and the research team have theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated the first on-chip tunable laser for orbital angular momentum (OAM) modulation and multiplexing.
