Some areas of special interest include: Tools for detecting natural selection in microbes The evolutionary origin of gene families Mining metagenomic sequence data Experimental evolution of microbes Modeling bacterial ecology Gene regulatory networks in bacteria Protein structure and design Teaching InterestsI have enjoyed teaching a variety of classes at MIT, spanning my own diverse interests in microbiology, computer algorithms, and thermodynamics of biomolecules. I am currently looking forward to teaching a new class on microbial evolution and genetics. Selected Publications Shapiro B.J. and Alm E.J.
