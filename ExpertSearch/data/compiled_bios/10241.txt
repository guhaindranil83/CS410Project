The robots feature a physical plant that captures the biomechanical advantages of the body form, a neuronal circuit-based controller, neuromorphic sensors, myomorphic actuators and a behavioral set based on action patterns, reverse engineered from movies of the animal models. Our controllers are based on neuronal circuits established from neurophysiology. To achieve real-time operation, we base our electronic neurons on nonlinear dynamical models of neuronal behavior rather than physiological models. We employ both UCSD electronic neurons and synapses (analog computers that solve the Hindmarsh-Rose equations) and discrete time map based neurons and synapses that are integrated on a DSP. Together these components provide an integrated architecture for the control of innate behavioral action patterns and reactive autonomy.EducationPh.D., University of California, Santa CruzB.S., University of California, Riverside Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewDevelopment of underwater robots for civil infrastructure and explosive sensing; neurophysiology and behavior biomimeticsSelected Research ProjectsUtilizing Synthetic Biology to Create Programmable Micro Bio-Robots Co-Principal Investigator, Office of Naval ResearchCollege Research Initiatives BioMachine Integration link Critical Infrastructure Sustainability and Security link Engineered Water, Sustainability and Health link Department Research Areas Civil Infrastructure Security Environmental Engineering Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsR.T.
