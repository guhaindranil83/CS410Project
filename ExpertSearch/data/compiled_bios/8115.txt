Sreenivas's home page Education Ph.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, 1990 M.S.E.E. Elec. & Comp. Engr. Carnegie Mellon 1987 B.Tech Electrical Engr. Indian Inst. of Tech. 1985 Biography I received a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, (IIT) Madras, India in 1985. I was at the IIT, Madras from 1980-1985. I have an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. I was at Carnegie Mellon between 1985 and 1990. I then moved to Harvard University, where I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in Decision and Control at what was then the Division of Applied Sciences. After a two-year stint at Harvard, I came to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I am an Professor with the Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering Department. I hold research appointments at the Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL) and the Information Trust Institute (ITI). I am also an affiliate of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, and an Arthur Davis Faculty Scholar at the University of Illinois. Academic Positions Research Professor, Information Trust Institute Research Professor, Coordinated Science Lab Departmental Affiliate, Electrical & Computer Engineering Professor, Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering Postdoctoral Fellow, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 1990-1992 Research Assistant, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 1985-1990 Teaching Statement At the undergraduate level I have taught courses in the controls curriculum (GE320: Introductory Control Systems; GE420: Digital Control of Dynamic Systems; GE423: Introduction to Mechatronics; GE424: State Space Design Methods in Control) in the General Engineering program. I have advised several projects in the industry-sponsored Senior Engineering Project (GE494: Senior Engineering Project I; GE495: Senior Engineering Project II) in the General Engineering curriculum. At the graduate-level I have taught advanced topic courses in the controls and the Industrial Engineering curriculum in the College (AE555: Multivariable Control Design; GE525: Discrete Event Systems; IE511: Integer Programming). I have been involved in the Master of Science in Financial Engineering Program since May 2006, when it was first conceived. This Cross-College Program that now involves several faculty from the Colleges of Engineering and Business. I teach IE523: Financial Computing in this program. This program is currently ranked 5th in the FE-Programs (cf. https://tfetimes.com/best-financial-engineering-program-rankings/). I also teach IE531: Algorithms for Data Analytics in the Data Analytics concentration of the IE Program. Research Statement My current research is on the Analysis, Control and Performance Evaluation of a broad class of systems known to the literature as Discrete-Event/Discrete-State (DEDS) Systems. Examples of DEDS systems include: air-traffic control systems; automated manufacturing systems; computer networks; integrated command, control, communication and information (C3 I) systems; operations-management of multi-component organizations with event-driven dynamics like shipyards, airports, hospitals, etc. I use the theories of Computation, Coding, Machine Learning, Approximate Algorithms, Online Algorithms and Information Theory to synthesize near-optimal supervisory policies for various problems involving DEDS Systems.
