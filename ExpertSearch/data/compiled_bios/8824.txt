The model offers relatively inexperienced entrepreneurs with limited capital resources a quick path to managing a company in which they have a meaningful ownership position. Since 1996, CES has conducted a series of studies on the performance of search funds (see links below). CES has identified and tracked more than 400 search funds raised since 1984in the United States and Canada. The growing cohort of international funds located throughout western Europe, Latin America, and India are tracked by our counterparts at IESE Business School in Barcelona, Spain. A 2020CES analysis of 401qualifying search funds (linked below) found the aggregate pre-tax internal rate of return to be 32.6%, and the aggregate pre-tax return on invested capital to be 5.5x. Featured Research Written2020 Search Fund Study: Selected ObservationsThe 2020 Search Fund Study reports on the financial returns and key qualities of search funds formed in the United States and Canada since 1984. This report updates the previous 2018 study with data through December 31, 2019. Featured Research WrittenSearch Fund PrimerFor those contemplating pursuing a search fund, or investing in one, the Center for Entrepreneurship Studies has created a practical guide to answer the most frequently asked questions. Faculty SpotlightH.IrvingGrousbeckThe MBA Class of 1980 Adjunct Professor of ManagementProfessor Grousbeck helped conceive of the search fund and advises many of the entrepreneurs who have used them. He expects that the use of search funds will continue to grow. Its the most direct way I know for aspiring MBA entrepreneurs to get into business for themselves. And now that there are many experienced search-funders out there, those who have gone earlier are advising those who have come along more recently. Our objective is to have the search-fund model grow, flourish, and be self-supporting, as one wave helps the wave behind it. Related FacultyDavid M. DodsonLecturer in ManagementPeter B.
