Lodish Professor of Biology and Biological Engineering, MIT; Founding Member, Whitehead Institute Harvey F. Lodish studies the development of red blood cells and the use of modified red cells for the introduction of novel therapeutics into the human body, as well as the development of brown and white fat cells. 617-258-5216 Phone WI-601C Office lodish@wi.mit.edu Email Lab Website Mary Ann Donovan Assistant 617-258-5217 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1966, Rockefeller University BS, 1962, Chemistry and Mathematics, Kenyon College Research Summary We identify novel genes involved in the terminal stages of erythropoiesis, the process by which red blood cells are produced, and elucidate functions of the genes and extracellular signals that regulate the self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation of early (BFU-E) erythroid progenitor cells. Weve characterized several molecules, including two that are FDA-approved drugs for other indications and show great promise as therapeutics for bone marrow failure disorders and erythropoietin-resistant anemias. We discover and elucidate the functions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are essential for the differentiation and function of erythroid and myeloid cells, and others essential for formation of white and brown adipose cells.
