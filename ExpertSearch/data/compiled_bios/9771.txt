Oliver Gao Professor Civil and Environmental Engineering 314 Hollister Hall 607/254-8334 Director of Systems Engineering Associate Director of the Cornell Program in Infrastructure Policy hg55@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyDr. Gao is a Professor in the graduate fields of 1) Civil and Environmental Engineering (Transportation Systems Engineering), 2) Systems Engineering, 3) Cornell Institute of Public Affairs (CIPA), and 4) Air Quality in Earth and Atmospheric Science at Cornell University. His research focuses on transportation systems, environment (especially air quality and climate change), energy, and sustainable development. He also studies sustainable food systems, quantifying and mitigating green-house gas emissions from food supply chains. He is a member of Transportation Research Board Committee on Transportation and Air Quality (ADC20), a member of Transportation Research Board Committee on Maintenance Equipment (AHD60), an academic member on the FACA Committee of US EPA MOVES model development, and a member (invited) on the editorial board of the international journal Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment. Gao received his graduate degrees (Ph.D. in CEE, M.S. in Statistics, and M.S. in Agriculture and Resource Economics) from the University of California at Davis in 2004, M.S. degree in Civil Engineering in 1999, and duel undergraduate degrees in Civil Engineering and Environmental Science in 1996 from Tsinghua University, China. Before joining Cornell, Gao was a quant in the mathematical and econometrical modeling division at the Rohatyn Group, LLG, a Wall Street hedge fund specializing in emerging markets.Research InterestsGao's research interests include transportation and environment/energy systems; mobile emissions inventory and air quality modeling; environment and energy impacts of alternative transportation (fuel, engine, infrastructure) technologies, methodological: statistics/econometrics, mathematical modeling & operations research, experimental; and environmental economics and complex networks of renewable energy supply chain.Mechanics of Biological MaterialsTransportationComplex Systems, Network Science and ComputationData MiningData ScienceHealth SystemsEnergy SystemsInformation Theory and CommunicationsScientific ComputingSystems and Networking Infrastructure SystemsEnergy and the EnvironmentTransportation Systems EngineeringAlgorithmsSelected PublicationsStasko, Timon H., Oliver Gao. 2012."Developing green fleet management strategies: repair/retrofit/replacement decisions under environmental regulation."Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice46(8): 1216-1226.Wang, Xun, Oliver Gao. 2011."Travelers' exposure to fine particle mass (PM2.5) and number concentrations in urban transportation environments in New York City."Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment16(5): 384-391.Kamarianakis, Y., Oliver Gao, B.
