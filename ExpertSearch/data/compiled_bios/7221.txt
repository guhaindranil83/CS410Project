Dr. Grijalva is a Member of the Federal Smart Grid Advisory Committee of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The Committee advises the U.S. electricity industry on smart grid interoperability standards and frameworks, and on grid modernization. Dr. Grijalva is a pioneer on decentralized power system control and energy internet, and a leading researcher on smart power systems and renewable energy integration. He has been the principal investigator for research projects under the U.S. Department of Energy, ARPA-E, EPRI, PSERC, NSF, several National Laboratories, and numerous industry sponsors. He has published 150 peer-reviewed papers. Dr. Grijalva is Co-founder and Chairman of ProsumerGrid, Inc., a company that is developing innovative DER grid simulation software and decentralized energy markets and control systems. Dr. Grijalva has combined background in computer science and electric power systems. He received his Electrical Engineer degree from EPN-Ecuador in 1994 and his MSc Certificate in Information Systems from ESPE-Ecuador in 1997. Dr. Grijalvas MS (1999) and PhD (2002) degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering are from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he also completed a post-doctoral program in Energy Systems. From 1994 to 1997, Dr. Grijalva was with the Ecuadorian National Control Center as an EMS Engineer and then Manager of the EMS Software Department. From 2002 to 2009, he was with PowerWorld Corporation developing commercial grade software for power system planning and optimization. He joined the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2009. From 2013 to 2014, he was with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as founding Director of the Power System Engineering Center (PSEC), where he supervised about 50 researchers and was responsible for the power system and grid integration research at the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF). Dr. Grijalva has been the recipient of Fulbright, University of Illinois, and Organization of American States Fellowships, and recipient of several awards including the Georgia Tech ECE Outstanding Faculty Award, Great Minds in STEM National Achievement Award, More Than Smart Grid Disruptor Award, and the IBM Faculty Award.
