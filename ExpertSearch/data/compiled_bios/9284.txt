Heald received her undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics from Queens University in Canada in 2000. She obtained her Ph.D. in Earth and Planetary Sciences from Harvard University in 2005, under the direction of Prof. Daniel J. Jacob. She was a recipient of both the Canadian NSERC Postgraduate Scholarship and the NASA Earth System Science Graduate Fellowship. Her thesis focused on transpacific transport of pollution and the use of inverse modeling to estimate emissions from aircraft and satellite observations. She was a recipient of the NOAA Global and Climate Change Postdoctoral Fellowship, which supported her research at the University of California Berkeley from 2006 through 2007, with Prof. Allen Goldstein and Prof. Inez Fung. She became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University in 2008 and moved to MIT in January of 2012. Heald is a member of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Scientific Steering Committee, the GEOS-Chem model Steering Committee, and the Community Earth System Model Advisory Board. She was a 2015 recipient of the James B. Macelwane Medal. Administrative Assistant: Jackie Foster | jafoster@mit.edu | 617 715 4038 Publications Xuan Wang, Colette L. Heald, Arthur J.
