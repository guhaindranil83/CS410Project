My goal is to enable robotic systems that can match or exceed the level of agility, efficiency, and robustness demonstrated by humans and animals, especially in challenging environments. One focus of my research is building on ideas from control, estimation, game theory, optimization, and physics to develop new algorithms. Another is designing and building hardware systems to bring these algorithms to life, including legged robots, teams of networked drones, and swarms of tiny satellites.
