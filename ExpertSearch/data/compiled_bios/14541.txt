His Chemical Process Optimization, Multiscale Modelling and Process Systems research program is focused on the development and implementation of theoretical and computational-based tools. These tools are aimed at improving the design and operability of chemical systems and also aim to provide new insight on industrially-relevant processes. Professor Ricardez-Sandovals research group has developed a set of methodologies that can be applied to a general class of chemical systems for process improvement. They have developed mathematical models that provide new insight about the mechanisms and operation of industrially-relevant processes. A key aspect in Professor Ricardez-Sandovals research is the implementation of uncertainty analysis to assess process variability under uncertainty. He strongly believes that model uncertainty is essential for designing efficient mathematical tools that can realistically be applied in process improvement practice. His research has been supported by federal government collaborators (CFI, ORF, NSERC, Mitacs, CanmetENERGY, Government of Canada); industrial partners (Activation Laboratories and Angstrom Engineering); and the Ontario Government; as well as the Early Researchers Award granted by the Ministry of Research and Innovation. In addition, he has received visitor scholars that have been financially supported by different agencies such as Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program (ELAP) and Canada-Brazil without borders. Professor Ricardez-Sandovals current nanotechnology interests focus on the development of multiscale models for manufacturing and catalytic processes such as thin film deposition and methane cracking reactions for the production of hydrogen and carbon nano-materials. He also aims to develop comprehensive mechanistic process models that can describe the behavior of CO2 capture technologies and new technologies for IGCC power plants for clean power production. Professor Ricardez-Sandovals research interests also include the development of new methodologies that can efficiently perform optimal design while considering the dynamics and controllability of the systems under uncertainty. He also develops novel and efficient mathematical formulations for optimal scheduling of large-scale facilities in order to improve operations management in the manufacturing and analytical service sectors.Research InterestsProcess ControlProcess DesignModelling and Simulation of Micro and Nano SystemsMultiscale modellingProcess Control applied to micro and nano systemsComputation-based toolsModel uncertaintyNanotechnologyDevelopment of multi-scale modelsIndustry-relevant catalytic processesCO2 capture technologiesProcess systems engineeringDynamic optimization under uncertaintyOptimal integration of design control and schedulingModelling simulation and optimization of advanced energy and CO2 capture systemsMultiscale process systemsEducation2008, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo2000, Master of Science, Chemical Engineering, Instituto Tecnologico de Celaya1997, Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Instituto Tecnologico de OrizabaCourses*CHE 522 - Advanced Process Dynamics and ControlTaught in 2015CHE 524 - Process Control LaboratoryTaught in 2015CHE 624 - Advanced Process Dynamics and ControlTaught in 2015NE 336 - Micro and Nanosystem Computer-aided DesignTaught in 2015, 2019CHE 725 - Research Topics in Analysis of Chemical ProcessesTaught in 2016CHE 720 - Special Topics in Analysis of Chemical ProcessesTaught in 2017CHE 121 - Engineering ComputationTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 420 - Introduction to Process ControlTaught in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsZheng H, Ricardez-Sandoval L, Budman H, Robust estimation and economic predictive control for dynamic flux systems under probabilistic uncertainty, Computers and Chemical Engineering, 140, 2020*Chaffart D., Ricardez-Sandoval L.(2017).
