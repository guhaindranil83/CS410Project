Her research is focused on action for a thriving livelihood for all and has taken forms such as translating neuroscience into learning and paper microfluidic devices. Her career trajectory, beginning in 1991, has included chairmanship of the Materials Engineering Department (2002-2007) and the flock leadership (2009-2015) of a transdisciplinary learning initiative involving 200 freshmen that was twice recognized by the Cal Poly Presidential Community Engagement Award (2012, 2014). She has designed and taught 35 different courses, advised over 50 senior projects and masters theses and authored 30 peer-reviewed articles (first author), among other things. Her career contributions were recently recognized by the inaugural 2016 Womens Engineering ProActive Network Leader in Engineering Education Award for outstanding new approaches that enhance engineering education and create inclusive environments for students. She earned her bachelors degree in metallurgical engineering (B.S.) from the Michigan Technological University and her graduate degrees in Materials Science and Engineering from Stanford University (Ph.D., M.S.).
