She received her Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering in 1992 from the University of California at Berkeley. Her Ph.D. thesis was on testing of analog and mixed-sginal circuits. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, Dr. Milor served as Vice President of Process Technology and Product Engineering at eSilicon Corporation, as Product Engineering Manager at Advanced Micro Devices, Sunnyvale, California, and was a faculty member at the University of Maryland in College Park. Dr. Milor has over 80 publications and four patents on yield and test of semiconductor ICs. She serves as a consultant and expert witness in the areas of circuit design, test, and semiconductor manufacturing, and has experience in testifying and depositions. Research interests: Reliability modeling for semiconductor processes Circuit performance (speed) modeling and prediction as a function of the characteristics of a process technology Analog and mixed-signal testing Yield modeling and prediction as a function of in-line data, test structure data, and design features Modeling of process modules (i.e. chemical-mechanical polishing, lithography, etc.) Statistical process modeling and characterization Digital testing Distinctions: 2004 Best Paper in the IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing NSF Career Grant, 1995 Member of Technical Program Committees for ISSM (International Symposium on Semiconductor Manufacturing), 2002-present, ICCAD (International Conference on Computer-Aided Design), 2006-present, VTS (International Conference on VLSI Test), 2006-present, ICCD (International Conference on Computer Design), 2007-present, DCIS (Design of Circuits and Integrated Systems Conference), 2007-present, NATW (North Atlantic Test Workshop), 2006-present, IMSTW (International Mixed-Signal Test Workshop), 1998-present Guest editor for IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing, Nov. 1999, special issue on IWSM'98. 1997 SRC Outstanding Industrial Mentor Award AMD's Best SRC Mentor Award, 1996 1999 Best Paper Award, AMD Technical Conference 1990 ICCAD Distinguished Paper for "Optimal Test Set Design for Analog Circuits" M.
