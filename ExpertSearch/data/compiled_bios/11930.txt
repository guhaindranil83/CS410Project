He received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Precision Instruments & Mechanology from the Tsinghua University, China in 1999 and 2002, respectively; the M.S. degree in Industrial Engineering, the M.S. degree in Statistics and the Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial and Operation Engineering, all from the University of Michigan in 2005, 2006 and 2008, respectively. Dr. Liu has more than ten years of research experience in data analytics and system informatics. His research specialty is in the fusion of multi-source, multi-scale and multi-level information in hierarchical and distributed systems for better system design, operation, and maintenance. By integrating engineering knowledge, optimization algorithms and the statistical analysis and learning of massive high-dimensional data, Dr. Liu and his research team advance the scientific research in system performance modeling, system prognostic/diagnostic, decision-making and risk management. These methodological advancements have been successfully applied in a variety of domains, such as manufacturing engineering systems, chemical and civil engineering systems and geographical information systems. His collaborations with domain experts have resulted in joint research projects in quality and reliability improvement for machining/assembly processes, mono-crystalline processes, and service improvement for water systems, software systems, and food assistance provision systems. Dr. Liu and his research team have published research papers in prestigious journals and conference proceedings, such as IISE-Transactions, IEEE Transactions, ASME Transactions and IISE annual conference proceedings. Dr. Lius research has been funded by US National Science Foundation, US Department of Homeland Security and US Air Force Office of Scientific Research. Dr. Liu is a member of INFORMS and a member of IISE. He served as a Council Member of Quality, Statistics and Reliability Section of INFORMS from 2012 to 2014, a Board Director of the Quality Control and Reliability Engineering (QCRE) Division of IISE from 2013 to 2015, the President-Elect of QCRE from 2015 to 2016. Dr. Liu is currently the President of the QCRE of IISE.
