Vakilzadian's field of expertise is in the area of modeling and simulation of continuous and discrete systems and their application in digital systems and their architectures.Vakilzadian has used his expertise in this area for the organization of national and international technical and educational conferences such as the International Conference on Simulation in Engineering Education, Society for Modeling & Simulation International (SCS) Western Simulation Multiconference on Simulation in Engineering; Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Conference on Electro-Information Technology (eit); and SCS Summer Computer Simulation Conference.Due to this extensive work, Vakilzadian was selected to organize and serve as general chair, program chair, or publicity chair of these conferences. Vakilzadian's collaboration and contributions to the Region 4 of IEEE, the local section of IEEE, and the local chapter of the IEEE Computer Society and his broad experience in this area has resulted in his appointment as chair of the IEEE West Area, PACE Committee Chair, and Technical Activities Committee Chair of Region 4 of IEEE. He has served as Vice President of SCS conferences and Vice President of SCS Education. Due to his leadership roles and editorial activities for SIMULATION: Transactions of The Society of Modeling and Simulation International, Dr. Vakilzadian has been awarded with the IEEE-USA Regional Professional Leadership Award; Nebraska Section Award for Leadership, Management, and Contribution to the Section; IEEE Region 4 Conference Committee Awards (2003-04, 2014); and SCS Distinguished Service Award, 2011.Vakilzadian has published in the area of modeling and simulation and its broad areas of application. He is the editor/co-editor of several educational hardbound volumes and the guest editor of the special issue of the Simulation Journal on simulation in engineering education. He has secured funding from sources such as NSF, NMIH, Altera, and HP as a PI and Co-PI for his scientific work.As a guest professor at the University of Hamburg, Germany, and the Institut national des sciences appliques (INSA) de Rouen, France, and a senior member of IEEE, Dr. Vakilzadian collaborates with the faculty of these universities.
