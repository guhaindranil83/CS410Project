Tizhoosh is a Professor in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Waterloo since 2001 where he leads the KIMIA Lab (Laboratory for Knowledge Inference in Medical Image Analysis). Before he joined the University of Waterloo, he was a research associate at the Knowledge and Intelligence Systems Laboratory at the University of Toronto where he worked on AI methods such as reinforcement learning. His research activities encompass artificial intelligence, computer vision, and medical imaging. He has developed algorithms for medical image filtering, segmentation, and search. As well, he has introduced the concept of "Opposition-based Learning". Dr. Tizhoosh has received more than $6.0 M in funding since 2001 for his research and commercialization activities through NSERC, OCE, FedDev, MITACS, MaRS, HTX, IRAP, ORF-RE and industry partners. He is the author of two books, 14 book chapters, more than 150 journal and conference papers, and multiple patents. He has more than three decades of industry experience and has worked with numerous companies such as Management of Intelligent Technologies GmbH (Aachen, Germany), Image Processing Systems Inc. (Photon Dynamics Inc. San Jose, CA), Semacode (Waterloo, ON), and Medipattern Corporation (Toronto). Additionally, Dr. Tizhoosh has more than 10 years of experience in commercialization and start-ups. In 2007, he started Segasist Technologies, a start-up that developed image segmentation software for radiation oncology. The company raised more than $2M under his leadership, both as CEO and CTO. He also planned and successfully managed an FDA 510k submission for computer-aided segmentation for prostate cancer with the help of Sunnybrook Hospital and the London Regional Cancer Centre. Presently, he is the AI Advisor of Huron Digital Pathology, St. Jacobs, ON, Canada. As well, he is a faculty affiliate to the Vector Institute, Toronto, where he leads a pathfinder project on using AI in radiology.Research InterestsArtificial IntelligenceMedical ImagingComputer VisionBiomedicalEducation2000, Doctorate, Technical Computer Science - Medical Imaging, University of Magdeburg1996, Master's, Electrical Engineering - Technical Computer Science, University of Technology AachenCourses*SYDE 201 - SeminarTaught in 2017SYDE 223 - Data Structures and AlgorithmsTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018SYDE 522 - Machine IntelligenceTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019SYDE 677 - Medical ImagingTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019SYDE 720 - Selected Topics in ComputationTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsPan-cancer diagnostic consensus through searching archival histopathology images using artificial intelligence Nature npj Digital Medicine, 2020 Kalra, Shivam; Tizhoosh, HR; Shah, Sultaan; Choi, Charles; Damaskinos, Savvas; Safarpoor, Amir; Shafiei, Sobhan; Babaie, Morteza; Diamandis, Phedias; Campbell, Clinton JV (Accepted in 2020)Heterogeneity-aware local binary patterns for retrieval of histopathology images Erfankhah, Hamed; Yazdi, Mehran; Babaie, Morteza; Tizhoosh, Hamid R; IEEE Access, 2019 (Accepted in 2019)Artificial Intelligence and Digital Pathology: Challenges and Opportunities Tizhoosh, HR; Pantanowitz, L; Journal of Pathology Informatics, 2018 (Accepted in 2018)Representing medical images with encoded local projections Tizhoosh, Hamid R; Babaie, Morteza; IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2018 (Accepted in 2018)Zhu, Shujin and Tizhoosh, HR, Radon Features and Barcodes for Medical Image Retrieval via SVM, arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.04675, 2016Mahootchi, M and Ponnambalam, K and Tizhoosh, HR, Response to the comments by Joodavi, A., and Mozafari, M. on Operations optimization of multireservoir systems using storage moments equations by M.
