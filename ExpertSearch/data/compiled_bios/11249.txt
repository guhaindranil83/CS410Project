Here in IIT where people lead a busy life, the name 'Tech Club' itself brings a breeze of happiness, relaxation, pleasure and many joyous moments to the employees and their family members. It is truly a place for leisure and entertainment beyond their hectic schedules. As many of the IIT community do not often get a chance to meet their relatives, Tech Club provides a unique opportunity to make them forget their homesickness by hosting various events throughout the year where colleagues and their families mingle with each other and cherish together. It in essence gives a 'home away from home feeling' to the club members making a big joint family.
