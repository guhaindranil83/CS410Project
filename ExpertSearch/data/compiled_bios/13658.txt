He also holds a Master of Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology (MBET) from the Conrad School of Entrepreneurship and Business at the University of Waterloo. Dr. Bachmann is primarily interested in studying the spatial economic and transport interaction (SETI) process, trade and transportation, and transport economics and finance. He is also interested in emerging technologies such as new mobility paradigms and next generation travel demand modelling. His research group has worked with various agencies including Transport Canada, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), the Region of Waterloo, Canada West Foundation (CWF), Innovation Science and Economic Development (ISED) Canada, and the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). In 2017, he received the Transportation Research Boards (TRBs) Fred Burggraf Award for excellence in transportation research by researchers 35 years of age or younger. Dr. Bachmann regularly teaches "Economics and Life Cycle Cost Analysis" (CIVE 392) and "Transportation Engineering Applications" (CIVE 341) to undergraduate engineering students at the University of Waterloo. He also teaches "Modelling Transportation and Spatial Economics" (CIVE 645) to graduate engineering students. In 2019, he received the University of Waterloos Faculty of Engineering Teaching Excellence Award for an ongoing record of excellence in undergraduate teaching.Research InterestsSpatial Economic and Transport InteractionTrade and Freight TransportationTransport Economics and FinanceNew Mobility ParadigmsNext Generation Travel Demand ModellingEducation2020, Master of Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology, Conrad School, University of Waterloo2015, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, University of Toronto2011, Master of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of Toronto2009, Bachelor of Applied Science, Civil Engineering, University of TorontoCourses*CIVE 292 - Engineering EconomicsTaught in 2015ENVE 292 - Economics for Environmental EngineeringTaught in 2015, 2016CIVE 341 - Transportation Engineering ApplicationsTaught in 2018CIVE 392 - Economics and Life Cycle Cost AnalysisTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019CIVE 444 - Urban Transport PlanningTaught in 2018CIVE 640 - Urban Transportation Planning Models: Principles & ApplicationsTaught in 2018CIVE 740 - Topics in Transportation EngineeringTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsTerry, Jacob and Bachmann, Chris, Spatial characteristics of transit-integrated ridesourcing trips and their competitiveness with transit and walking alternatives, Transportation research record, 2674(3), 2020, 329 - 340Wang, Wilson and Saari, Rebecca K and Bachmann, Chris and Mukherjee, Ushnik, Estimating transboundary economic damages from climate change and air pollution for subnational incentives for green on-road freight, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 82, 2020Lessan, Javad and Fu, Liping and Bachmann, Chris, Towards user-centric, market-driven mobility management of road traffic using permit-based schemes, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 141, 2020Bachmann, Chris, Calibrating and Applying Random-Utility-Based Multiregional Input--Output Models for Real-World Applications, Networks and Spatial Economics, 19(1), 2019, 219 - 242Shahrokhi Shahraki, Hamed and Bachmann, Chris, Designing computable general equilibrium models for transportation applications, Transport Reviews, 38(6), 2018, 737 - 764 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
