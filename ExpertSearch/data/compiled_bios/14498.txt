In particular, his quantitative finance research focuses on models of volatility, dynamics of limit order books and market-making techniques.Teaching InterestsI have always felt that a great teacher was someone who could turn the driest course into an engaging experience. This is particularly true in mathematics and engineering classes, where yawns are much more common than bursts of laughter. I therefore think that my duty as a teacher goes beyond competently explaining the material; it is essential to present it in an entertaining and interesting way. I have found that it helps if it is done with a sense of humor. Another way of engaging students is to offer them problems that challenge them. After all, isn't the feeling we get after solving a difficult problem what makes us love math?Selected PublicationsCont, R., Sasha Stoikov, R Talreja. 2010."A Stochastic model for order book dynamics."Operations Research58(3): 549-563.Avellaneda, M., J.
