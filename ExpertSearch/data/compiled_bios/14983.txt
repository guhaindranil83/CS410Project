Prior to that, he was an assistant professor in the Multiscale Modeling and Simulation Laboratory at Universit Paris-Est in France, and held a visiting assistant professor position in the Duke Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He earned an MS (2005) and PhD (2008) in Theoretical Mechanics from the University of Lille 1 Science and Technology (France), and received his Habilitation (2014) in Mechanics from Universit Paris-Est. Habilitation is the highest academic degree in France. Dr. Guilleminots research focuses on uncertainty quantification, computational mechanics and materials science, as well as on topics at the interface between these fields. He is particularly interested in the multiscale analysis of linear/nonlinear heterogeneous materials (including biological and engineered ones), homogenization theory, statistical inverse problems and stochastic modeling with applications for computational science and engineering.
