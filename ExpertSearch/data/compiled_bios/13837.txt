Storey, Ph.D. Professor of Mechanical Engineering Milas Hall 267 781-292-2579 brian.storey@olin.edu EducationPh.D., Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley M.S., Mechanical Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign B.S., Mechanical Engineering, University of Texas, Austin Select Courses TaughtReal World MeasurementsTransport PhenomenaModeling and ControlLinearity IIResearchFluid dynamics Microfluidics Biography Dr. Storey holds a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, a M.S. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a B.S. from the University of Texas at Austin, all in mechanical engineering. Dr. Storey's research interests and experiences are in the broad areas of fluid dynamics and computational science, including applications such as microfluidics, geophysical flows, and cavitation. Current research projects involve electrokinetic flows in micro and nano-scale devices, and non-linear dynamics in fluid networks. Dr. Storey has received NSF funding to support undergraduate research projects at Olin. These projects have led to publications authored by undergraduate students as well as student talks at professional conferences. Recently, Dr. Storey has been aiding in the development in a new two-week school which offers research training to scientists from developing countries.
