Vos Assistant Professor of Biology Seychelle M. Vos investigates how genome organization and gene expression are physically coupled across molecular scales. 617-253-5595 Phone 68-583A Office seyvos@mit.edu Email Lab Website Meg Rheault Assistant 617-253-1809 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2013, University of California, Berkeley BS, 2008, Genetics, University of Georgia Research Summary We study the interplay of gene expression and genome organization. Our work focuses on understanding how large molecular machineries involved in genome organization and gene transcription regulate each others function to ultimately determine cell fate and identity. We employ a broad range of approaches including single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, biochemistry, and genetics to mechanistically understand how these molecular assemblies regulate each other across molecular scales.
