She joined the faculty at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1991. She spent a sabbatical year at Bell-Labs Lucent in 1999, and was a visiting faculty at MIT in the fall of 2000. She joined the ECE faculty as an associate professor in the fall of 2001. Chuanyi Ji's research lies in both basic and applied areas of networking and machine learning. Her research interests include investigating fundamental properties and deriving engineering solutions for modeling and managing heterogeneous large networks, developing learning algorithms and their applications in networks, and seeking knowledge and insights from large-scale network data. Research she has been involved with includes resilience of the energy grid and communication networks, proactive anomaly detection, scalability of measurement-based network monitoring, and performance and efficiency issues of learning algorithms.
