Prior to that, he studied at the University of Alberta and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland and worked as a structural engineering consultant with Cohos Evamy (now Dialog) in Edmonton. Scotts research focuses primarily on improving the safety and durability of metal structures in civil engineering applications. His research projects have investigated topics including: fatigue assessment and retrofitting of welded metal structures, encouraging the use of lighter, more corrosion resistant materials in new construction, and the development of new connection concepts to enable modular construction and reduce the costs associated with deconstruction and adaptive reuse. His research employs a broad range of tools, including laboratory testing, fracture mechanics, structural reliability theory, and life-cycle cost analysis. Currently, Scott is active on a number of CSA design code committees. In particular, he is chairing the aluminum structures technical subcommittee of the Canadian bridge design code (S6), as well as serving actively on the S6 technical subcommittee for steel structures, and the technical committees for the structural steel and aluminum welding codes (W59 and W59.2) and the aluminum structures design code (S157). In recent years he has served on the editorial boards for the IABSE journal: Structural Engineering International and the ASCE Journal of Bridge Engineering. Scott is also currently serving as Director for Waterloos new Architectural Engineering undergraduate program.Research InterestsFatigue assessmentFatigue retrofittingWelded metal structuresAluminum StructuresSteel StructuresModular constructionDesign for deconstructionStructural testingFracture mechanicsStructural reliability analysisLife-cycle cost analysisEducation2005, Doctorate, Civil Engineering, Steel Structures Laboratory (ICOM) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)1998, Master's, Structural Engineering, University of Alberta1996, Bachelor's, Civil Engineering, University of AlbertaCourses*CIVE 400 - Civil Engineering Design Project 1Taught in 2015CIVE 414 - Structural Concrete DesignTaught in 2015CIVE 498 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2016CIVE 265 - Structure and Properties of MaterialsTaught in 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019CIVE 700 - Topics in Structural EngineeringTaught in 2015CIVE 401 - Civil Engineering Design Project 2Taught in 2016CIVE 512 - Rehabilitation of StructuresTaught in 2017, 2018GENE 119 - Problems SeminarTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsFernando, D and Walbridge, S and Wan, B, A Markovian-based methodology for the life-cycle cost analysis of bridge maintenance interventions under changing deterioration rates, Journal of Civil Engineering Inter Disciplinaries, 1(1), 2020, 1 - 12Enshassi, Mohammed SA and Walbridge, Scott and West, Jeffrey S and Haas, Carl T, Dynamic and Proactive Risk-Based Methodology for Managing Excessive Geometric Variability Issues in Modular Construction Projects Using Bayesian Theory, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 146(2), 2020Shah, LH and Fleury, A and St-George, L and Walbridge, S and Gerlich, AP, Evolution of process parameters in friction stir welding of AA6061 aluminum alloy by varying tool eccentricity, The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 109(5), 2020, 1601 - 1612Ranjan, Rakesh and Walbridge, Scott and Shah, Luqman and Gerlich, Adrian, Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics Analysis of Friction Stir Weld Fatigue Performance, , 58, 2020Sjaarda, Matthew and West, Jeffrey S and Walbridge, Scott, Reliability Analysis of Welded Stud Shear Connectors on Simply-Supported Bridge Girders, Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering, 2020Shah, LH and Huda, N and Esmaeili, S and Walbridge, S and Gerlich, AP, Structural morphology of Al-Mg-Si alloy friction stir welds through tool eccentricity, Materials Letters, 2020Enshassi, Mohammed SA and Walbridge, Scott and West, Jeffrey S and Haas, Carl T, Probabilistic Risk Management Framework for Tolerance-Related Issues in Modularized Projects: Local and Global Perspectives, ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, Part A: Civil Engineering, 6(1), 2020 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
