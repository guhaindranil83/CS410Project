His research interests are in piano design, organology, physical systems, animal growth modelling, and environmental systems. Professor Birkett has now completed the bulk of his research in early iron and is in the process of starting to draw wire for pianos. He has been working with high-speed imaging of various fortepiano actions. The P-wire has been thoroughly researched, developed and tested over the past decade by Professor Birkett, and is about to enter commercial production. It is drawn in the proportional Nuremburg sizes and has been reported to have the added advantage of natural corrosion resistance.Research InterestsPiano designorganologyphysical systemsanimal growth modellingenvironmental systemsComputer Simulation of SystemsModeling & SimulationEducation1990, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo1986, Master's, MASc, University of Waterloo1976, Bachelor's, BSc, University of London,King's CollegeCourses*SYDE 114 - Numerical and Applied CalculusTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019SYDE 351 - Systems Models 1Taught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019SYDE 312 - Applied Linear AlgebraTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMasoudi, Ramin and Birkett, Stephen, Experimental validation of a mechanistic multibody model of a vertical piano action, Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, 10(6), 2015Masoudi, Ramin and Birkett, Stephen and McPhee, John, A Mechanistic Multibody Model for Simulating the Dynamics of a Vertical Piano Action, Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, 9(3), 2014Birkett, Stephen, The slippery path from piano key to string, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 136(4), 2014, 2132 - 2132Birkett, Stephen, Experimental investigation of the piano hammer-string interaction, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 133(4), 2013, 2467 - 2478Borland, Matt and Birkett, Stephen, The implementation of pyschoacoustical signal parameters in the wavelet domain, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 132(3), 2012, 1886 - 1886 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
