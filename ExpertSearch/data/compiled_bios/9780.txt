Warner Associate Professor Civil and Environmental Engineering Hollister Hall, Room 373 607/255-7155dhw52@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyDerek Warner joined the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering in October 2007. Prior to this he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Division of Engineering at Brown University, where he worked in the Mechanics of Solids Group. He completed his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in 2006. During the 2013 academic year, Derek was a Visiting Professor in the Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory at cole polytechnique fdrale de Lausanne in Switzerland.Research InterestsDerek is the current director of the Cornell Fracture Group. The group conducts both scientific and engineering research aimed at understanding and predicting the deformation and failure of structures. A primary scientific goal of the group is to illuminate and model the underlying physical mechanisms that control the failure of engineering materials. The group's effort in this area supports the group's engineering objective to advance the capability to predict the deformation and failure of structures through the utilization of new knowledge and modeling techniques. Through its research, the Cornell Fracture Group strives to increase the standard of living across the globe by enabling better performing, lower cost, and more sustainable technologies.Computational MechanicsComputational Solid MechanicsAdvanced MaterialsEnergy and the EnvironmentAdvanced Materials ProcessingNanotechnologyScientific ComputingStatistical Mechanics and Molecular SimulationStructural EngineeringTeaching InterestsSolid Mechanics, Deformation and Failure Mechanisms, Computer ModelingService InterestsUndergraduate Academic Advising, Undergraduate Research Advising, Graduate Admissions, Faculty Search Committee CEE, IT Advisory Committee for College of Engineering, Web-based Interface Structure Databank, NSF Proposal Review, Conference Symposium OrganizationSelected PublicationsAghababaei, R., D H.
