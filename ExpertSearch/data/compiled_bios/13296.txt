Jaakkola Professor Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Tommi S. Jaakkola received M.Sc. in theoretical physics from Helsinki University of Technology, 1992, and Ph.D. from MIT in computational neuroscience, 1997. Following a postdoctoral position in computational molecular biology (DOE/Sloan fellow, UCSC) he joined the MIT EECS faculty 1998. His research interests include many aspects of machine learning, statistical inference and estimation, and analysis and development of algorithms for various modern estimation problems such as those involving predominantly incomplete data sources. His applied research focuses on problems in computational functional genomics such as transcriptional regulation.
