Sc. Degree in Biomedical Engineering and Instrumentation from the Tianjin University in July 1989. She then attended the University of Virginia where she obtained her M. Sc. Degree in Biophysics in May 1992, M. Sc. Degree in Electrical Engineering in January 1993, and Ph.D. Degree in Electrical Engineering in January 1995. She spent the summer of 1995 at the Tokyo Institute of Technology as a visiting researcher. She has been with the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech since September 1995, first as an assistant professor (1995-2000), then as an associate professor (2000-2005), and professor (2005-). Dr. Zhou is a member of the Center for Signal and Image Processing (CSIP) at Georgia Tech. Dr. Zhou has played an instrumental role in establishing Georgia Tech's presence in China and currently serves as Director for Georgia Tech - Shenzhen.
