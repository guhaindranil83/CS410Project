His professional areas of interest include medical informatics, healthcare systems engineering, and broadening participation in engineering and computing. Dr. Subbian leads the Computational Medicine and INformatics (COM-IN) Collaboratory,an engineering-driven, cross-disciplinary biomedical research and training hub at the UA. Funded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), research efforts in the COM-IN Collaboratory leverage systems engineering and computational methods including machine learning for clinical and healthcare applications. Current patient populations of interest include cardiovascular diseases, traumatic brain injury, and mental health disorders. Dr. Subbian is the principal investigator on an NSF Smart and Connected Health award to develop advanced computational models and tools for critical care medicine, particularly traumatic brain injury prognosis. Dr. Subbians educational research is focused on ethical decision-making and formation of identities in engineering. His work in ethics education has been featured in the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Exemplars in Engineering Ethics Education, an effort aimed to improve students understanding of ethical practice and research in engineering. Currently, he co-leads the STEM in HSI working group and the Data Science Ambassadors Program at the UA. He also leads the Collaborative for Engineering Education Research and Outreach (CEERO), a cross-college, interdisciplinary network of faculty, staff, and students to promote engineering education at all levels.
