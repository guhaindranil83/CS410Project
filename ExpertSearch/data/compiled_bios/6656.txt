Structural Dynamics Our work focuses on several aspects of structural dynamics such as modeling, vibration suppression, vibro-acoustics, nonlinear systems, control, testing and validation. Our work strongly focuses on bridging the theoretical and experimental field in order to provide well-validated and trustworthy systems. Our testing labs feature several distinct capabilities such as 3D laser non-contact measurements, non-contact excitation, high-bay labs, overhead cranes, temperature-controlled vacuums, and ground isolation platforms. Adaptive Structures By adaptive structures we refer to structures thathave the ability toadapt,evolveorchangetheir properties or behavior in response to the environment around them. Much of this work is accomplished with domain-coupled material such as piezoceramics and shape memory alloys and use much of the techniques we use in structural dynamics to achieve, for example, high precision control and structure integration in a native way. This takes in theVibrations, Adaptive Structures and Testing (VAST)Laboratory directed by me. Smart Infrastructure As founder and co-Director of theVirginia Tech Smart Infrastructure Laboratory, I have led a team focusedon research in topics that utilize sensor information to improve the design, monitoring and daily operation of civil and mechanical infrastructure as well as to investigate how humans interact with the built environment.This work features the fully instrumented Goodwin Hall with over 240 accelerometers through the building.
