These thin film semiconductors are used in electronicdevices such as transistors, solar cells, and thermoelectrics. Our group studies both organic andinorganic semiconducting materials using a combination of physical characterization methods to elucidate their electronic andstructural properties. Additional areas of interest include functional polymers for sensing and actuation.
