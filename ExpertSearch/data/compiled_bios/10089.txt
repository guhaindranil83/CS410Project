Caltech, 2014-. Assistant(s) Research Group Matters Carolina Oseguera 362 Gates-Thomas Laboratory (626) 395-4271 susta@caltech.edu Research Group Website Research Overview Professor Asimaki's research combines geotechnical engineering, computational mechanics and structural dynamics to study natural ground surface features and man-made geotechnical systems --such as ridges, valleys, dams, tunnels, building foundations and offshore structures. She is particularly interested in assimilating high fidelity numerical simulations,field and experimental data, to develop engineering design models of infrastructure, resilient to hazards on urban scales and regional scales.
