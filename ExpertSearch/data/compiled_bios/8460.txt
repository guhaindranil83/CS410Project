Craig Fox Harold Williams Chair and Professor of Management Most decisions from which investment to choose to how to treat a disease to whether or not to go to war must be made without knowing in advance how they will turn out. Successful decisions under uncertainty depend on our minimizing our ignorance, accepting inherent randomness and knowing the difference between the two. craig.fox@anderson.ucla.edu (310) 206-3403 About Biography Publications Video Biography Craig Fox is the Harold Williams Chair and Professor of Management at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, with joint appointments as professor of psychology at the UCLA College of Letters and Sciences and professor of medicine in the UCLA Geffen School. Fox co-founded the Behavioral Science & Policy Association and is co-editor of its flagship journal, Behavioral Science & Policy (BSP). He is also the co-director of the Interdisciplinary Research Group on Behavioral Decision Making at UCLA. Foxs research focuses on decision behavior, especially under conditions of risk and uncertainty. He uses a variety of research methods, including surveys and lab experiments, field studies and analysis of archival data, and neuroimaging. His research has been published in top journals of management, psychology, economics, law, neuroscience and general science. Much of Foxs work entails application of behavioral economics and social psychology to public and private sector policymaking. The success of nearly all public and private sector policies hinges on the behavior of individuals, groups and organizations, says Fox. This is where scientific research comes in, he says: Policymakers often are unaware of insights from behavioral science that may help them craft and execute more effective and efficient policies. For instance, in a recent set of projects Fox and his colleagues applied behavioral techniques to nudge physicians to reduce their tendency to over-prescribe antibiotics, which contributes to the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Our research team has developed several new approaches to reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, drawing on insights from behavioral economics and social psychology, Fox wrote in the New York Times. These disciplines acknowledge that people do not always behave rationally and are strongly motivated by social incentives to seek approval from others and compare favorably to their peers. Techniques used in his most recent study almost completely eliminated inappropriate prescribing. Fox joined the UCLA faculty in 2003 after six years at Duke Universitys Fuqua School of Business. He teaches MBA and executive courses in managerial decision-making, negotiation, leadership, strategy and dynamic management, as well as Ph.D. courses in decision-making.
