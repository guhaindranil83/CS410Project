D. Yoder received the B.S.E.E. degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY in 1989, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1991 and 1993, respectively. Upon graduation, he accepted a research position with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. He subsequently worked as a Member of Technical Staff at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and then with its micro-/opto-electronics spin-off, Agere Systems. Dr. Yoder joined the faculty of Georgia Tech in Fall 2003. Research interests: High-speed photodetectors and electro-absorption modulators RF testing, modeling and simulation Monte Carlo charge transport simulation Semiconductor device physics Distinctions: Member of Tau Beta Pi Member of Eta Kappa Nu Recipient of Hertz Foundation Graduate Research Grant (University of Illinois, 1990) Recipient of Unisys Scholarship (Cornell, 1988) Recipient of MITRE Corporation Scholarship (Cornell, 1986) P.
