Lawrence Barbara S. Lawrence Professor Emeritus and Distinguished Research Professor I study organizations to make them better places to work. barbara.lawrence@anderson.ucla.edu Areas of Expertise: Careers Critical Thinking Organizational Demography Organizational Reference Groups Social Networks Social Norms About Biography Publications Recognition Biography Barbara Lawrence joined the UCLA Anderson faculty in 1983. The second woman promoted to full professor at Anderson, Lawrence studies organizational reference groups, the evolution of organizational norms, internal labor markets and their influence on employees career expectations and implicit work contracts, and the effect of population age change on occupations. A career-switcher herself, Lawrence has taught MBAs at the crossroads of their professional advancement. Indeed, her field didnt exist as such when she was starting out, but jobs she held in her student days and early career gave her fly-on-the-wall opportunities to study human behavior and organizational dynamics. She began to observe how, when and where decisions were being made. She was inspired to ask, How do you put together an organization that helps people do their best? Her earliest research concerned the myth of the midlife crisis and led her to study what happened to people at different ages over the course of their working lives. What is acceptable to do at certain ages? she wondered, and found, in part, that employees shared beliefs about age norms and distributions inform how they value each other, and themselves. Norms evolve and define who is ahead of schedule, who is on schedule and who is behind. Its an HR problem we typically think of as being the result of age. I found that people were quite different from each other at the same age. The norms where they worked were different. Looking at individuals in social contexts is crucial in creating diverse and equitable workplaces. People dont generally recognize that, even when they work in the same organization, individuals broad reference groups differ, says Lawrence. Scholars tend only to infer, not identify, the people an individual is aware of at work. This surmise creates no problem in groups or small organizations where everyone knows everyone else. However, it becomes troublesome in large organizations where the set of people one individual discerns may vary considerably from that of another. Lawrences latest research asserts that, although our tendency to associate with similar others may fundamentally underlie human relationships, the academic literature on this subject, which is called homophily, neglects the meaning people attribute to and derive from those positive ties. Lawrence finds that researchers often use measures in current studies that imply but do not capture how individuals interpret and attach importance to their associations or similarities. Kurt Lewins famous remark that there is nothing so practical as a good theory is really recognition that good explanations work precisely because of their close connection to empirical observation, she says. Lawrences research has been published widely in peer-reviewed journals and funded by the National Institutes of Health. A former concert flutist, she believes she may be the only business school professor who has taught the history of jazz.
