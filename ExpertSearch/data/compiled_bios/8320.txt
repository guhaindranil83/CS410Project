Since beginning her own laboratory, first at Duke University School of Medicine and now as Professor of Medical Science at Brown University, she has become a leader in the field of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Dr. Kauer has organized and chaired the Gordon Research Conference on Synaptic Transmission in 2006, and she was a member of the NINDS Board of Scientific Counselors from 2008-2013. She recently was recognized for her contributions to synaptic neurobiology by being named Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The Kauer lab has made key contributions to our understanding of synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses in the brain circuitry underlying reward and addiction, and recently has identified for the first time synaptic plasticity at glycinergic synapses, a type of inhibitory synapse prevalent in the spinal cord.

PubMed Research Research Overview My laboratory focuses on understanding molecular mechanisms involved in synaptic plasticity and modulation of neuronal excitability using modern electrophysiological techniques in brain slices. Our work is related to understanding fundamental processes in memory, in drug addiction and in chronic pain. Research Statement My major research focus for many years has been on synaptic plasticity, the strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections between neurons. Synaptic plasticity is a basic property of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system and is used in distinct brain regions for neuroadapations to various environmental stimuli. My lab's work has recnetly focused in two regions of the central nervous system 1) the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA), where we have been testing the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity is an early change that occurs during stress and is essential for addiction to drugs of abuse, and 2) the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, where synaptic plasticity contributes to the development of persistent pain. My lab uses electrophysiological recordings from neurons in acutely prepared slices, as well as optogenetic activation of specific neurons to identify their roles in circuit function. We have also utilized viral transfection, transgenic mice, and other tools to manipulate the protein environment in neurons to probe the roles of particular molecules in synaptic function. My lab was one of the first to examine the relationship between synaptic plasticity and drugs of abuse. We and others have found that after even a single exposure to a drug of abuse in vivo, synapses in the VTA are potentiated. Amphetamine produces this potentiation within two hours of administration, consistent with an LTP-like mechanism. We have also demonstrated that a form of LTD at the same synapses is entirely blocked by brief exposure in vitro to low doses of amphetamine. We believe that the block of LTD by psychostimulant drugs may promote LTP of the same synapses and contribute to the development of addiction. We currently have two major directions in the VTA. First, we have discovered an entirely novel form of plasticity at VTA synapses. Little has previously been known about plasticity of inhibitory GABAergic synapses, and indeed many inhibitory synapses do not exhibit plasticity like their excitatory neighbors. We now find that inhibitory GABAergic VTA synapses express robust LTP mediated by an entirely novel intracellular signaling cascade. This LTPGABA is entirely blocked by morphine, suggesting a novel site of action for this drug in the reward circuit. Our recent work demonstrated that not only morphine but also other abused drugs and a brief stressor block LTPGABA and potentiate excitatory synapses. We know that stress can precipitate drug-seeking in animals that have undergone drug withdrawal, suggesting the idea that when LTPGABA is blocked (by stress), an individual may be more likely to relapse to drug use. We have found that stress-induced relapse to drug seeking correlates with the block of LTPGABA, and that a kappa opioid receptor antagonist rescues both LTPGABA and prevents stress-induced drug seeking in a rodent model of relapse. Our secondarea of research involvescharacterizing synaptic plasticity at synapses between afferents carrying pain information and neurons in slices of spinal cord. We are examining different dorsal horn neurons to see which cells are involved, and we will also test synaptic function in slices in models of neuropathic pain. We have identified a novel form of synaptic plasticity at synapses in the dorsal horn at glycinergic receptors. Although glycine is one of the three major neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system, very little is known about glycinegric synapses. We find that the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1beta, rapidly causes potentiation of glycinergic synapses on specific neurons in the dorsal horn pain circuit. Intriguingly, the same potentiation occurs rapidly following inflammation of the paw. We are continuing to characterize this novel form of plasticity and its relationship to pain. We have also begun to use optogenetic stimulation in tissue slices to understand the circuits activated selectively by nociceptors. Overall, our work in synaptic plasticity demonstrates that multiple signaling pathways are utilized at various CNS synapses to bring about changes in synaptic strength. Furthermore, our work in the reward system and dorsal horn emphasizes the idea that changes in synaptic strength contribute to neuroadaptations of many brain systems beyond those used to store memory per se. The interactions of drugs of abuse and of pain fibers with LTP and LTD mechanisms illustrate this idea: distinct environmental inputs may modify or perturb existing CNS systems to bring about long-lasting behavioral changes. My work thus is relevant both at the basic level, describing the building blocks of the nervous system, and at the translational level, suggesting targets for therapeutics that may enhance memory or combat addiction or chronic pain.
