This scenario dramatically changed during the last 35 years. Now we think that initially the universe was rapidly inflating, being in an unstable energetic vacuum-like state. It became hot only later, when this vacuum-like state decayed. Quantum fluctuations produced during inflation are responsible for galaxy formation. In some places, these quantum fluctuations are so large that they can produce new rapidly expanding parts of the universe. This process makes the universe immortal and transforms it into a multiverse, a huge fractal consisting of many exponentially large parts with different laws of low-energy physics operating in each of them.Professor Linde is one of the authors of inflationary theory and of the theory of an eternal inflationary multiverse. His work emphasizes the cosmological implications of string theory and supergravity.Current areas of focus:- Construction of realistic models of inflation based on supergravity and string theory- Investigation of conceptual issues related to the theory of inflationary multiverse Academic Appointments Professor, Physics Administrative Appointments Harald Trap Friis Professor in Physics, Stanford University (2008 - 2015) Professor of Physics, Stanford University (1990 - Present) Professor, Lebedev Physical Institute (1985 - 1989) Junior Research Fellow, Lebedev Physical Institute (1975 - 1985) Honors & Awards Gamow Prize, Russian-American Science Association (2018) Kavli Prize in Astrophysics, The Kavli Foundation (2014) Member, The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (2014) Fundamental Physics Prize, Fundamental Physics Prize Foundation (2012) Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2011) Correspondent Member, Academy of Sciences and Humanties in Hamburg (2010) Member, National Academy of Sciences (2008) Medal of the Institute of Astrophysics, Institute of Astrophysics (2006) Thomson Scientific Laureate in Physics, Thomson Reuters (2006) Robinson Prize for Cosmology, Newcastle University (2005) Humboldt Research Award, The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (2004) Peter Gruber Prize for Cosmology, The Gruber Foundation (2004) Dirac Medal, International Centre for Theoretical Physics (2002) Oskar Klein medal, Stockholm University (2001) Lomonosov Award, Academy of Sciences of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (1978) Boards, Advisory Committees, Professional Organizations Staff Member, European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) (1989 - 1990) Professional Education Ph.D., Lebedev Physical Institute, Physics (1975) B.S., Moscow State University, Physics (1971) Contact Academic alinde@stanford.edu University - Faculty Department:&nbspPhysics Position:Professor VARIAN 340 Stanford, California 94305-4060 (650) 723-2687 (office) (650) 494-6106 (office) (650) 725-6544 (fax) Additional Info Mail Code: 4060 Links Curriculum Vitae PDF List of publications on inSPIRE List of publications in Google Scholar 2020-21 Courses Electricity, Magnetism, and OpticsPHYSICS 23 (Win) Independent Studies (1) ResearchPHYSICS 490 (Win, Spr, Sum) Prior Year Courses 2018-19 Courses Electricity, Magnetism, and OpticsPHYSICS 23 (Win) Electricity, Magnetism, and Optics LaboratoryPHYSICS 24 (Win) 2017-18 Courses Electricity, Magnetism, and OpticsPHYSICS 23 (Win) Electricity, Magnetism, and Optics LaboratoryPHYSICS 24 (Win) All Publications KKLT without AdS JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS Linde, A. 2020 View details for DOI 10.1007/JHEP05(2020)076 View details for Web of Science ID 000535281800001 de Sitter minima from M-theory and string theory PHYSICAL REVIEW D Cribiori, N., Kallosh, R., Linde, A., Roupec, C. 2020; 101 (4) View details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.101.046018 View details for Web of Science ID 000514691100008 Mass production of type IIA dS vacua JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS Kallosh, R., Linde, A. 2020 View details for DOI 10.1007/JHEP01(2020)169 View details for Web of Science ID 000511543200001 CMB targets after the latest Planck data release PHYSICAL REVIEW D Kallosh, R., Linde, A. 2019; 100 (12) View details for DOI 10.1103/PhysRevD.100.123523 View details for Web of Science ID 000502791100006 de Sitter Vacua with a Nilpotent Superfield FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS Kallosh, R., Linde, A., McDonough, E., Scalisi, M. 2019; 67 (1-2) View details for DOI 10.1002/prop.201800068 View details for Web of Science ID 000456687200014 The Landscape, the Swampland and the Era of Precision Cosmology FORTSCHRITTE DER PHYSIK-PROGRESS OF PHYSICS Akrami, Y., Kallosh, R., Linde, A., Vardanyan, V. 2019; 67 (1-2) View details for DOI 10.1002/prop.201800075 View details for Web of Science ID 000456687200009 On the Problem of Initial Conditions for Inflation FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS Linde, A. 2018; 48 (10): 124660 View details for DOI 10.1007/s10701-018-0177-9 View details for Web of Science ID 000446010300010 Report Accessibility Issues Powered By CAP Network Stanford University SU Home Maps & Directions Search Stanford Terms of Use Copyright Complaints Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305
