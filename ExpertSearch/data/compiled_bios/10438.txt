Krogstad is an assistant professor in the Department of Material Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She received her PhD in Materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara working with Prof. Carlos G. Levi in 2012. Between 2012 and 2014, she held a postdoctoral appointment in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University with Prof. Kevin J. Hemker. She has authored more than 20 peer-reviewed papers and 4 patents. These highlight her interests in phase and microstructural evolution in both ceramic and metallic systems, including contributions on thermal barrier coatings, nanocrystalline superalloys, oxidation, corrosion and engineering education. She is the recipient of a DOE Early Career Award, an NSF CAREER Award, the TMS Young Leaders Award, a Royal Academy of Engineering Distinguished Visiting Fellowship, the ACerS Robert L. Coble Award for Young Scholars and the TMS Early Career Faculty Fellow Award. Her current research efforts include ceramics and metals processing, microstructural evolution of porous ceramics subject to irradiation and extreme thermal gradients, microstructural contributions to twin-mediated, non-linear deformation of polycrystalline ceramics, defect engineering in metallic thin films to understand accelerated phase transformations, oxidation resistance and dislocation-twin interactions relevant to fatigue. Research Statement Our group focuses on understanding materials in nonequilibrium configurations and the evolution thereof, so as to generate and optimize unique functionality for operation in dynamic and extreme environments. Today, continued advancement in transportation, communication, energy conversion, and many other critical technologies relies on performance of materials, often under harsh conditions where chemistry, scale and morphology may change significantly over the coarse of operation. Understanding how traditional design criteria evolve in these environments is vital not only for lifecycle and failure analysis, but once understood, these can be used to improve performance or develop alternative material systems.
