Is boosting the sales of corn ethanol the right move?11/26/2018 ME Professor Andr Boehman looks into the facts about corn ethanoland how it may not be the best resource to start backing. The government aims to boost ethanol without evidence that it saves money or helps the environment11/26/2018 Andre Boehman says increasing ethanol blended with gasoline can damage older machines and do little to curb climate change.
