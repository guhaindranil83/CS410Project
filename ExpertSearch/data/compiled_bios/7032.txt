After graduation she worked as a visiting scientist with the National Institute of Aerospace at NASA Langley Research Center and joined the University of Virginia in the spring of 2018. Dedic is an active member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), and serves on the AIAA Technical Committee on Aerodynamic Measurement Technology. Professor Dedics research interests are centered around the development and application of advanced laser-based diagnostics and nonlinear spectroscopy techniques to study nonequilibrium, reacting, and multiphase flow environments with the goal of furthering the development of technologies related to clean energy and hypersonic propulsion and aerodynamics. In particular, Dedic has experience in applying complex laser measurements to study harsh environments while emphasizing measurement accuracy and spatial and temporal resolution.
