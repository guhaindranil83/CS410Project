Dillon Medal, American Physical Society Alfred P. Sloan Fellow Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award Presidential Young Investigator, National Science Foundation Research Description:Theoretical analysis of complex fluids and polymers including suspensions, polymer solutions, and melts, and especially block and graft copolymers. A major effort involves the development of new computer simulation tools for analyzing statistical field theory models of polymers and complex fluids -- "field theoretic simulations" -- and the application of such tools to the design of improved complex fluid formulations and high performance plastic materials.
