(Chemical Engineering) - 1987, Auburn University B.S. (Chemical Engineering) - 1985, University of Maryland ResearchMy research interest resides with creating new devices using nanotechnology and microfluidics for transformative use. My lab is currently exploring two major frontiers of research: (1) microfluidic-based 3D human tissue and tumor models that can be used for preclinical drug evaluation and personalized medicine and (2) wearable graphene oxide (GO)-based biosensors for mobile health. These are student-centric efforts that are aimed at envisioning the transformative use of our ideas. My laboratory has produced 7 winners of the New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame Graduate Student Award over the past decade. One of the students co-founded Bonbouton to commercialize our sensor technology. Also, several undergraduate and high school students perform research every year in my laboratory with notably one of them, David Monteiro, receiving the prestigiousBarry Goldwater Scholarship in 2013.Experience Professor and Chair, Deparment of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Stevens Institute of Technology, 2020 - present Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, 1997-2020 George Meade Bond Chair of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science,Stevens Institute of Technology, 2009-2019 Chair, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, 2001-2005 Associate Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, Stevens Institute of Technology, 1997-2001 Research Staff Member, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, July 1992 to July 1997 Research Scientist, United Technologies Research Center, February 1990 to July 1992 Honors & Awards Master of Engineering (Honoris Causa): Stevens Institute of Technology, 2008 Academic Research Award: Printed Electronics USA Conference, 2011.
