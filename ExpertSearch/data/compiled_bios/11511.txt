Teaching Interests Teaching Interests Gas Dynamics, High-Speed Aerodynamics and Propulsion Biography Biography Professor Donald Wilson has over 50 years of experience in the fields of gas dynamics, high-speed aerodynamics and propulsion. He earned the BSAE degree from The Georgia Institute of Technology, MSAE from The University of Tennessee (Space Institute) and PhD in Engineering from UT Arlington. He was involved in the development of electric arc heaters and MHD accelerators for hypersonic wind tunnel applications at the Air Force Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), and in the development of supersonic aircraft inlets at LTV Aerospace and Defense Company prior to joining UTA in 1968. Dr. Wilson also spent two summers at NASA Lewis (now Glenn) Research Center as a NASA/ASEE Faculty Fellow. He was actively involved in the NASA/DOE National MHD Power Generator Program. Dr. Wilson was responsible for the establishment of the UTA Aerodynamics Research Center, and was involved in the development of its numerous test facilities. He was awarded the AIAA Ground Testing Award in 2001. Dr. Wilson directed the NASA/UTA Center for Hypersonic Research from 1993 until 1997, and also initiated the UTA detonation wave engine research programs in 1994. He is the former Chair of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, and is currently serving as Associate Chair responsible for academic programs.
