According to Dean Crouch, the first current faculty member elected to the Academy. https://www.uta.edu/president/news/messages/2019/02-07-agonafer-nae.php A student centric version of the announcement can be found at https://www.theshorthorn.com/news/uta-engineering-professor-honored-with-national-academy-membership/article_72e863ba-3403-11e9-bfff-1b1df6b51e02.html On March 2020, Professor Agonafer was presented the Howard University Alumni Award for Distinguished Postgraduate Achievement In the field of Engineering at the 153rd Charter Day Dinner. https://www2.howard.edu/2020-achievement-awards Professor Agonafer is married to his wife Carolyn and they have two children; a son, Dr. Damena Agonafer who is Professor of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science at Washington University in St. Louis, and a daughter, Dr. Senayet Agonafer, a Radiologist, who works at Lennox Hill Radiology in New York City.Statement on Research ActivityProfessor Agonafer is currently advising 14 PhDs and 13 MSc students and has successfully graduated 234 graduate students since he joined UTA in 1999 (a record for the university) including 25 PhD students. Since joining UTA, he has received several million dollars of funding as well as multi-million dollar donations in equipment. His current research areas are and is primarily tied to two centers he directs Electronics MEMS and Nanoelectronics Systems Packaging Center founded by him when he joined UTA in 1999. Shortly after, he established a Certificate in Electronic Packaging which continues to thrive and attract numerous students. In 2011 an NSF IUCRC - NSF Industry University Collaborative Research Consortium (I/UCRC) in the area of Energy Efficient Systems was established in collaboration with other universities. The NSF Center was recently awarded a Phase II and will continue until 2022. Prior to joining UT Arlington in 1999, Professor Agonafer had a 15-year career at IBM, joining the company immediately after receiving his PhD from Howard University in 1984. As the IBM Center of Competence for Computer Aided Thermal Engineering, he was a pioneer in promoting a concurrent engineering methodology for thermo/mechanical design and modeling of electronic packaging. While in industry, he also taught undergraduate and graduate level courses at CCNY and Columbia University. In the following, a brief summary of his research activities is presented.Data Center: Data center energy consumption continues to increase with the proliferation in online services such as social networking, banking, entertainment etc. Recent estimates show that associated power consumption accounts for around 2% and 1.8% of electricity production in the United States and worldwide respectively. He was one of the first in academia to address this problem and his first student received an MS on this topic in 2003. Veerendra Mulay, who received both an MS and PhD under his guidance, made quite a bit of contribution in this field. His PhD thesis was entitled Analysis Of Data Center Cooling Strategies And The Impact of The Dynamic Thermal Management On The Data Center Energy Efficiency. It was one of the first studies to look into dynamic thermal management in data centers. The concept of Dynamic Thermal Management depends on sensing local data and actuating the cooling resources dynamically thereby improving thermodynamic efficiencies. This will result in significant potential energy savings. Dr. Mulay started working at facebook immediately after graduation and has been an active member of the facebook data center thermal design team. The data center work continues to thrive and in 2011, his colleagues from SUNY Binghamton, Villanova, Georgia Tech and he received an NSF Award to establish an NSF IUCRC was formed. The NSF I/UCRC in Energy- Efficient Electronic Systems (E2S) is a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center started in 2010 and includes UT Arlington, SUNY Binghamton, Villanova and Georgia Tech. ES2 develops methodologies for efficiently operating electronic systems, including data centers, by controlling cooling resources and managing workloads to achieve optimal energy consumption. There are thousands of data centers across the United States that handle a wide spectrum of information and processing needs for the government, military, business and industry. It is quite significant as it enables a collaborative effort between industry and academia with many opportunities for additional NSF funding. One of the highlights of the Center regarding UT Arlington is the fact that Facebook joined the consortium and that the agreement with Facebook is the first such University funded project in the State of Texas. The Phase I agreement expired in 2017, and the center has recently received a Phase II extension to 2022 with a current funding for UTA of $425K / year ($100K/year from NSF). In December 2012, he gave a luncheon talk at the Annual Data Center Dynamics held in Dallas (http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/conferences/2012/dallas-2012). He will also be participating again in December 2013 (http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/conferences/2013/dallas- 2013?l=programme). CBS-DFW also interviewed his team on the work with Facebook (http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2011/11/23/uta-grad-students-get-grant-to-make-facebook-faster/). In addition, local companies such as CommScope and Mestek are in the consortium with discussions to add Amazon and AT&T. With the help of the University, he has built a data center research facility in Nedderman Hall. In June 2015, he received over 1 million dollars worth of servers from Yahoo for the data center: Yahoo! Labs delivered 480 computer servers to the UT Arlington College of Engineering on Wednesday, June 24, to further research led by mechanical engineering professor Dereje Agonafer into more efficient systems for cooling essential network equipment. - See more at: http://www.arlington-tx.gov/news/2015/06/25/yahoo-donates-480-servers-to-ut- arlington/. According to Yahoo, At Yahoo, we are excited to continue bolstering computer science in academia with our largest cumulative server donation ever. Yesterday, Yahoo Labs Academic Partnerships team and the Yahoo Data Center Operations group had the pleasure of delivering 480 servers to the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). Combined with the 250 servers Yahoo donated to UTA in late 2012, the gift amounts to the most servers Yahoo has donated to any individual institution in our YSTAR (Yahoo Servers to Academic Researchers) program since its inception in 2010. - See more at: http://yahoolabs.tumblr.com/post/122430939166/yahoo- bolsters-computer-science-in-academia-with scheduled to house 250 servers, worth million dollars from Yahoo (already received), and 180 servers worth million dollars from Facebook (two triplets and 60 servers already received) - making it one of the largest, data center research facility in the nation. It will also serve the computational needs of some other researchers within the University. As Site Director, he has hosted the Industrial Advisory Board Meeting for the NSF I/UCRC Center on Energy Efficient Systems at the UT in 2012, 2014, 2016 and Spring 2018. Attendees included participants from NSF, SUNY Binghamton, Villanova and Georgia Tech and over 18 industries.Reliability: A major breakthrough in packaging was migrating from peripheral to area array packaging by introducing solder as interconnect (C4, IBM). In the early 2000, the impact of introducing lead-free solder due to the legislation restriction, generated numerous researches to characterize the lead-free alloys and evaluate the interconnect reliability. At the time, Nokia Research Center and INDT funded UTA to work in this area and one of the topics was addressed by Dr. Mohammad Hossain, one of his PhD students at the time and now a Senior Reliability Engineer at Intel, who addressed a research question to develop constitutive equations for SnAgCu alloy and also evaluation of SAC solder interconnects reliability under different loadings. Professor Agonafer received funding in this area from Nokia and a number of papers were published including the first multi-design variable optimization problem related to packaging using ANSYS entitled Design Optimization and Reliability of PWB Level Electronic Package, Journal of Electronic Packaging, March 2007, Volume 129, Issue 1, pp. 9-18. In subsequent years, Dr. Nikhil Lakhkar, now at Emerson, studied the "Effect of Structural Design Parameters on Wafer Level CSP Ball Shear Strength and Their Influence on Accelerated Thermal Cycling Reliability. In spring 2014, he received a 3 year TI sponsored SRC research project entitled Birth-to-death (from die metal/passivation processing to board assembly) Modeling Methodology for the Optimization of Custom Board-Level Reliability. As board complexity grows and diversifies, there is an urgent need to develop a system-level methodology for the study and optimization of BLR reliability that is portable to different types of board and package designs. The project will deliver a model to experiment correlation database as well as a hierarchical and modular BLR analysis Ansys tool-box, along with component dependent guidelines. His students in this area have joined and are making contributions in industry including GlobalFoundries, Intel, Micron, Google and Tesla.3D Packaging: The convergence and miniaturization of computing and communications dictates building up rather than out. Moores law will continue but while it is still possible to double the amount of transistors in a single device, beyond 28nm node, it will be difficult to do so at a reduced cost. In Chapter 15 of ITRS 2.0 Heterogeneous Integration, it states that As traditional Moores law scaling becomes more difficult, innovation in assembly and packaging enabling functional diversification through Heterogeneous Integration (HI) and allowing scaling in the third dimension must take the slack. 3D packaging can be used to delay the onset of a new technology node while leveraging packaging to gain performance with existing nodes. The 3-D arrangement provides opportunities for new circuit architectures based on the geometrical ability to have greater numbers of interconnections among multi-layer active circuits. Presently, stack dice are used widely as low- power memory applications because thermal management of 3D architecture such as high-power processors inherits many thermal challenges. Inadequate thermal management of three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs) leads to reduction in performance, reliability, and ultimately system catastrophic failure. Since 2005, Professor Agonafer has been advocating addressing the thermal and mechanical challenges in 3D packaging. He started this effort in 2004 when he worked as a consultant at Intel providing guidance on their thermal modeling methodology. He has given numerous short courses and published extensively in this area. In September 2006, he gave the opening keynote seminar entitled Thermo-Mechanical challenges in stacked packaging at the 17th International Symposium on Transport Phenomena (ISTP-17) in Toyama, Japan. The presentation was subsequently published in a journal. It is with this background that one of his students came with a question he wanted to address: an innovative approach to cooling of stacked packages. The title of his dissertation was Development Of An Experimental And Analytical Model Of An Active Cooling Method For High-Power Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuit (3d-Ic) Utilizing Multidimensional Configured Thermoelectric Modules. Dr. Phan published extensively in this area and they have since patented the idea (Multidimensional heat transfer system for cooling electronic components, US 20120211204 A1). Dr. Phan is now CEO of a company and we continue to collaborate. In 2012, a patent application was filed (Thermal Reliability Testing Systems With Thermal Cycling And Multidimensional Heat Transfer, Application number: 20140103947). I was a Co-PI (Dr. Jain, PI) on an NSF Goali research project Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of Thermal Transport in Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits (3D ICs). The proposed work resulted in key experimental data on heat dissipation in advanced three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) and led to a better understanding of fundamental inter-die heat transfer mechanisms in 3D ICs. I plan to submit a follow up proposal with Dr. Jain as Co-PI.Hierarchical thermal modeling: he was one of the pioneers in this area; his paper on compact modeling is a seminal paper in the field, inspiring many other research groups to use this approach. He has always been on the leading edge in forecasting technology and has long been an advocate for the use of computer aided design in electronics cooling and has organized over 50 panels and numerous conference sessions on this subject. In 1994, he organized and led a team of five US speakers to speak on computational fluid dynamics at the World Conference on Computational Mechanics in Chiba, Japan. In 2012, he completed an SRC project entitled Development of a Best Known Method (BKM) for Design of Microprocessors used in Stacked Packages Based on Power and Thermal-Architectural Co- Design where he and his colleagues from the University of Toronto and SUNY Binghamton focused on co-design of microprocessors. The co-design topic is now a hot research area.Publication: Related to publication, he and his team have published over 200 papers. In 2013, he co-authored a book on data centers (Encyclopedia of Thermal Packaging, Set 2: Volume 1: Energy Optimization and Thermal Management of Data Centers, ISBN: 978-981-4327-60-2) and in 2014, I wrote a chapter on 3D Packaging in a book entitled . He serves as an IEEE CPMT Associate Editor as well as Editor in Chief of ASME Book Series in Electronic Packaging (a book in Electronic Packaging was published in 2011). He is a Fellow of The American Society of Mechanical Engineers International (ASME) and Fellow of The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Currently he serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of an NSF Center, Mid- Infrared Technologies for Health and the Environment (MIRTHE) at Princeton University since 2007 as well as on the Deans Engineering Advisory Committee at both University of Colorado and Howard University. His biggest pride is from the contributions his students are making at such companies as Delphi, Intel, and Facebook. In 2014, 5 of his PhD students received awards including John Fernandes who received a Best Poster Award at The 2014 IEEE ITHERM (1/81) (http://www.uta.edu/engineering/news-events/news- archives/2014/05-itherm-best- poster.php). Furthermore, Fahad Mirza received The ASME EPPD Student of the Year Award, Montreal, Ca (IMECE 2014), http://www.uta.edu/engineering/news-events/news-archives/2014/11-mirza-eppd-award.php). Dr. Mirza received his PhD in December 2014 and is now a Senior Engineer at Global Foundries.
