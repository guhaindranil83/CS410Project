Her graduate work in designing andunderstanding non-viral gene delivery from hydrogel scaffolds was supervised by Prof. Lonnie Shea. She pursuedpost-doctoral training at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne under the guidance of Prof. JeffreyHubbell, where her focus was self-assembled polymer systems for gene and drug delivery. Professor Segura'sLaboratory studies the use of materials for minimally invasive in situ tissue repair. On this topic, she haspublished 113 peered reviewed publications to date. She has been recognized with the Outstanding YoungInvestigator Award from the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, the American Heart Association NationalScientist Development Grant, and the CAREER award from National Science Foundation. She was Elected to theCollege of Fellows at the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineers (AIMBE) in 2017. She spent thefirst 11 years of her career at UCLA department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and has recentlyrelocated to Duke University, where she holds appointments in Biomedical Engineering, Neurology andDermatology.
