Prior joining Georgia Tech as an assistant professor in 2019, he was a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UT Austin from 2018-2019. He also held intern positions in Broadcom Ltd. in Sunnyvale, California, and NXP in Tempe, Arizona during 2013-2014. His research interests are broadly in analog, mixed-signal, and RF integrated circuits. His expertise is in high-performance data converters, ultra-low-power low-cost sensor interface, and novel analog mixed-signal architectures for design automation. Dr. Li is the recipient of the IEEE Solid-State Circuit Society Predoctoral Achievement Award in 2018. He also received the HKUST Academic Achievement Medal in 2012 and the UT Austin Cockrell School of Engineering Fellowship in 2017, respectively. He is member of the IEEE Solid-State Circuit Society and the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society.
