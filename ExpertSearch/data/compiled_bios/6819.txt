Research Interests Develop and apply thermodynamic and kinetic theory and experiments of phase transformations and interface motion to solve important industrial and scientific problems. Current research includes: Understanding how specific microstructures can be designed in poycrystalline materials and thin films by control of interface properties Developing models for how single crystal nanowires nucleate and grow using the VLS (vapor-liquid-solid) method Improving the manufacturing and reliability of the current generation of Pb-free solder interconnects on printed circuit boards Developing new nanoparticle-based interconnect structures for next generation circuit assembly Carol Handwerker Research Interests Classes MSE 230 Structure and Properties of Materials ENGR 103 - Materials that Impact our Lives: Electronics, Energy and the Environment Graduate Students Joseph Andler Xi Chen Xianyi Hu Ziyun Huang Elizabeth Mcclamrock Matthew Michie Francisco Montes Congying Wang Yifan Wu Alyssa Yaeger Keisuke Yazawa Ruwen Zheng Our People MSE Directory Faculty Staff Business Office Staff Faculty Emeriti Courtesy Appointments Adjunct Faculty Graduate Students Research Staff Post-Doctoral Research Staff Alumni Information Faculty Books Published Discover Students Online Faculty Alumni Partners Explore Campus Map Facts & Figures Schools News & Events Visit Us Connect Employment Engineering Computer Network Intranet Brightspace myPurdue People Engineering Directory Contact Us Social Media Media Contacts Purdue Directory Follow Purdue University, 610 Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, 765-494-4600 2020 Purdue University | An equal access/equal opportunity university | Integrity Statement | Copyright Complaints | Brand Toolkit | Maintained by the Engineering Computer Network Contact Office of Marketing and Media for accessibility issues with this page | Accessibility Resources | Contact Us | Email webmaster-mse@ecn.purdue.edu to report a problem
