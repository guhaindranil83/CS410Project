View Full Profile Nan Niu Associate Professor, CEAS - Computing Sciences & Informatics 832 Rhodes Hall 513-556-0051 niunn@ucmail.uc.edu My current research interests focus on the information seeking strategies that developers use in software engineering. I take an ecological-evolutionary, foraging-theoretic approach to understanding and improving developers' search for relevant information in their daily activities, such as debugging, refactoring, and reuse. My research group investigates how the task environment and the information environment re-shape developers' behaviors, or more accurately, how the developers' behaviors and their environments co-evolve, each shaping the other in important ways. My CAREER project (see http://ceas.uc.edu/news-1415/niu-receives-nsf-career-award.html) links software developers' rational behaviors together with their social information foraging, learning, and co-creation.

Wilsey Professor, CEAS - Elec Eng & Computer Science 836 Rhodes Hall 513-556-4779 wilseypa@ucmail.uc.edu My research is primarily in High Performance Computing with applications to Data Science and Parallel Discrete-Event Simulation. I also have interests in Privacy Preserving Data Mining, Embedded Systems, and Point-of-Care medical devices. I have been working with Partitioning, Parallelism, and Approximate Methods to improve the performance of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology. Because TDA algorithms have exponential time and space complexity, decomposing and partitioning the data into regional subspaces has dramatic impact on the overall performance. I have also initiated work on streaming persistent homology and on the computation of persistent homology on Big Data. In Big Data Clustering, I have been working to combine random projection hashing with locality sensitive hashing to implement high performance, distributed privacy preserving data mining. The projection and hashing approach permits us to perform clustering on distributed data sets by exchanging only hash keys between the distributed nodes. We are promoting these techniques to enable clustering and nearest neighbor search across HIPAA protected medical databases. In addition, I have been working extensively for many years to advance the field of Parallel and Distributed Simulation (PDES) using the Time Warp mechanism. Most recently we have been studying the design of solutions for the pending event set problem for high performance simulation on multi-core and many-core platforms. I have also initiated studies to extract profile data from discrete event simulation models to obtain quantitative data that I plan to use to focus my algorithm development for parallel simulation. Finally, I sometimes work with the local BioSensors group and the College of Medicine to develop point-of-care medical devices to assist patient monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment.
