She focuses her scholarship in both high fidelity and virtual reality simulation and is a national leader and expert in simulation. Her scholarship has culminated in developing the Simulation Model to Improve Learner and Health Outcomes (SMILHO).Current Research Grants and Programs Closing the loop: new data tools for measuring change in the quality for nursing education and the value of new approaches to instruction (PI) University of Michigan School of Nursing. Interactive anatomy-augmented virtual simulation training (PI with Voepel-Lewis) Archie MD Award Number 045889 A Multi-Modal Interprofessional Training to Improve Chemotherapy Safety (Co-I) (Friese-PI) project website http://most.nursing.umich.edu Virtual Reality-Based Team Training to Improve Patient Outcomes in Pediatric Cardiac Arrest-(Co-PI with Mahajant) project website https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/michelle-aebersold/research-projects/we-heart-vrTeachingA day in Dr. Aebersolds class is often a novel experience. You may find yourself climbing Mount Everest or trying to figure how tall a structure you can build to hold your marshmallow so your team can win. The next class might be trying to save an 68-year-old women suffering a stroke. Dr. Aebersold uses innovative teaching strategies such as case based learning, virtual reality or augmented reality, simulation (computer based and mannequin) in her courses for both graduate and undergraduate students. She teaches in the area of leadership in complex system, quality and safety and management and operations. Using a student centered teaching approach she engages her students in learning activities to further their learning and develop skills to support their success.Affiliations / Service Vice-President of Operations, International Nursting Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning Board of Directors Member, Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) Research Committee, 2015-present Chair, International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning, Board of Directors Bylaws Committee Co-Chair Education and Networking Group, National Nursing Practice Network, 2010-2016 Member, International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning, Standards Committee, 2014-2016Notable Awards / Honors Finalist, Macy Scholar, 2016 Fellow, American Academy of Nursing, 2015 Certified Simulation Health Care Educator, 2015 Certificate of Excellence in Reviewing-Clinical Simulation in Nursing, 2014 Interprofessional Fellow, Center for Interprofessional Education, University of Michigan Excellence in Research, Midwest Nursing Research Society Systems Research Interest GroupEducation PhD, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 2008 MSBA, Madonna University, Livonia, MI, 1991 BSN, Madonna University, Livonia, MI, 1985Publication HighlightsOchylski, D., Aebersold, M., & Kuebrich, M.
