After Berkeley he was a postdoctoral researcher in Microsoft Research New England, and has been at the faculty of MIT since 2009. Costis is interested in Algorithmic Game Theory,Applied Probability and Algorithmic Statistics, particularly in computational aspects of markets and the Internet, in social networks, and in computational problems in Biology. His research is motivated by two questions: how does the algorithmic perspective influence Economics, Biology, Statisticsand Physics? and how does the study of computational problems arising from areas outside Computer Science transform the Theory of Computation? Costis and his collaborators, Paul Goldberg and Christos Papadimitriou, were honored by the Game Theory Society with the first Game Theory and Computer Science Prize for their work on the Computational Complexity of Nash equilibria. Their same work was honored with the 2011 SIAM Outstanding Paper Prize. Costis was also the recipient of the2006 Best Student Paper Award at the ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce,a 2007 Microsoft Graduate Research Fellowship, the2008 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award, a 2010 Sloan Foundation fellowship in Computer Science,the 2011 MIT Ruth and Joel Spira Awardfor Distinguished Teaching, a 2012 Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship, a 2015 Research and Development Award by the Vatican Giuseppe Sciatica Foundation and a 2013 Best Paper and Best Student Paper Award in the 14th Conference on Electronic Commerce.
