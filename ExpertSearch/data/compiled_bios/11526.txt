Haji-Sheikh of the University of Texas at Arlington (1994-2002) and independently 2003-2007 on microscale heat transfer. Developed Green's function solution to general microscale heat transfer equation and applied to thermomodulation of thin metal films and parameter estimation. Explored the probes effect on experimental data.Worked with Bill D. Cook of the University of Houston (1990-1992) to test an optical probe as a linear device, line receiver of ultrasound. Tested optical probe on continuous wave ultrasound (check angular spectrum of "beam") and extended applicability to controlled input, low amplitude ultrasonic pulses. Teaching Interests Teaching Interests Measurements for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Analysis theory and hands on experience for undergraduate engineering students. Biography Biography Born March 3, l954 in Norton Kansas. Raised in Colorado and moved to Texas to work in the petroleum industry for twelve years with Sun Oil Company in onshore, offshore, and management positions. First female Sun Oil drilling engineer. Returned to school for MS and PhD. Have teaching for about 10 years. Education Education 2002 PhD in Mechanical Engineering The University of Texas at Arlington, 2002 1992 MS in Mechanical Engineering Univ Houston Main Campus, 1992 1976 BS in Petroleum Engineering Colorado School of Mines, 1976 Licensure and Certifications Licensure and Certifications 1988 Professional Engineer, License, Texas State Board of Professional Engineers Appointments Appointments Sept 2017to Sept 2019 Lecturer Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington (Arlington, United States) Teaching MAE 2381 Methods and Measurements I and other courses as requested by the department. Two new MAE 2381 experiments should be available to students before Fall 2020: a totally new beam experiment, and a bike experiment outfitted with a torquemeter and tachometer (in development for several years).In Spring 2019, iPad with spectrogram app added as an experiment.Last major upgrade to computer software and lab equipment completed in Fall 2017. Jan 2012to Sept 2017 Adjunct Professor Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Texas at Arlington Assigned to the following three courses, with and without a GTA. Wrote homework, exams; prepared lectures, in-class demonstrations.MAE 3309: Thermal Engineering, 3 hours, F02, S03, F03, S12, F13 MAE 2360: Numerical Analysis, 2 hours lecture + 1 lab, F12, S12, S15 MAE 3360: Engineering Analysis, 3 hours, F12, S13, F13MAE 2381: Measurements and Methods I, 2 hours lecture + labs, S14 (4 labs), F14 (2 labs), S15 (4 labs), F16 (3 labs), S17 (3 labs). Assigned to lecture sections of 50+ or 100+ students who attend separate lab sections, each currently run by a GTA team member. Handled coordination and planning for the MAE 2381 Team. Initiated log to track equipment. Improved student learning opportunities by updating computers and lab equipment and rewriting a manual appendix introducing windowing and Fourier transforms. Team activated a not-in-service and a never-in-service experiment and updated student lab manuals. Team emphasized academic ethics in formal lab reports, lecture homework and exams. 2002to 2003 Adjunct Professor Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Texas at Arlington Assigned to the following three courses, with and without a GTA.
