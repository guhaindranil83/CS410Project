At a billionth of a degree above absolute zero, laser-cooled and trapped gases of neutral atoms are among the coldest objects in the universe. We employ thesequantum gases as versatile simulationtestbeds and sensorsfor exploring novel quantum matter and their applications. Our recentprojectsfocus on: Quantum neural network computing and quantum spin glassusing quantum gasmultimode cavity QED -We have theoritically descibed how aconfocal cavity QED neural networkcan enhanceassociative memory recall and storage capacity -We realized a versatile set of novelphoton-mediated interactions among atoms and dynamical spin-orbit coupling -Read more about theconfocal cavity QED neural network,multimode cavity QED,photon-mediated interactions, anddynamical spin-orbit coupling. 1D dipolar quantum gases of the most magnetic atom, dysprosium, to studyquantum nonequilibrium physics -We discovered novelquantum many-body scar states and made adipolar quantum Newtons cradle -Read more aboutquantum many-body scar statesand thedipolar quantum Newtons cradle. Imagingtransportincondensed matter materials with a BEC using ournovel Scanning Quantum CRyogentic Atom Microscope (SQCRAMscope) -We took thefirst local images of electron nematic transport in iron-based high-Tc superconductors -Read more about theSQCRAMscopeand our study of electron nematics.
