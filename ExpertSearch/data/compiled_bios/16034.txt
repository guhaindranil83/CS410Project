His expertise is in the areas of nanotechnology-enabled flexible hybrid electronics, nano-photonics, emerging nano-electronics, III-V semiconductor, Silicon CMOS device fabrication, and beyond-CMOS devices with low-dimensional nano-materials including CNT and graphene. Prior to that, Jeongwon was a scientist at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University from 2014 to 2016. At SLAC, he developed and implemented nanofabrication and microfabrication methods for advanced x-ray optics and nano-photonic devices at the Stanford Nano Center, Stanford Nanofabrication Facility, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Dr. Park has worked closely with different industrial partners. For six years, he served as a senior technologist to support the corporate Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and business units at Applied Materials, US. He also actively worked with Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) as an industrial mentor, liaison and proposal reviewer for overall SRC research strategies. Jeongwon has been a guest researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories (LBL, NCEM), a visiting scholar in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, and an adjunct professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Santa Clara since 2009. He received his Ph.D. (2008) in Materials Science and Engineering from the University of California, San Diego. During his Ph.D., he focused on nano-electronics with carbon nanotubes and organic field effect transistors including fabrication within a clean room, experience with CMOS, MEMS, packaging, device processing/measurements, simulations and modeling tools. Jeongwon's current research interests include nano-technology-enabled flexible hybrid electronics and sensors.
