Through the combination of theory, simulation, and experiment, we use fundamental principles in chemical engineering (thermodynamics, transport, and kinetics) in the broad field of colloid and interface science. This enables us to solve challenging practical problems, including emulsification and surfactant self-assembly, wetting and nanomaterial synthesis, gas separations and water desalination, and drug delivery. Research Interests colloid and interface science; thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and molecular simulations of surfactant self-assembly and hydrophobic solute micellar-enhanced solubilization in aqueous media; thermodynamics, molecular simulations, and kinetics of the dispersion and stabilization of nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, graphene, MoS2) using solvents and aqueous surfactant solutions; transdermal and oral drug delivery Education Ph.D., Tel-Aviv University, 1983 M.Sc., Tel-Aviv University, 1979 B.Sc., Tel-Aviv University, 1977 Publications Honors and Awards Capers and Marion McDonald Award for Excellence in Mentoring and Advising, 2015 Outstanding Faculty Award, ChemE Dept, MIT: 1991, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, and 2015 Society of Cosmetic Chemists, Best Poster Award, 2004 NE Society of Cosmetic Chemists, Best Paper Award, 2001 Controlled Release Society, Dow Corning Award, 1999 American Pharmaceutical Association, Ebert Prize, 1996 Harvard Health Letter, Outstanding Research Award, 1996 NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award, 1989 Computer Programs Website CONTACT Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Chemical Engineering 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Room 66-350 Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 Accessibility | Site Map CONNECT SEARCH Search for: 2007-2020 MIT Department of Chemical EngineeringCredits
