My formal training is in electrical engineering and applied mathematics. I find that some of the more interesting problems I have worked on have come from looking at the real world with a strongly quantitative toolset. Along the way, I have spent time at a hedge fund and consulted for private industry and the U.S. Government. Finally, at the moment I am the associate head for undergraduate studies in the department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering.
