Research Interests: Stem Cell Biology and Aging Overview: Dr. Jangs lab uses multi-disciplinary approaches to study muscle stem cell biology and develops bioactive stem cell delivery vehicles for use in regenerative medicine. Dr. Jangs lab studies both basic aspects of muscle stem cell biology, especially systemic/metabolic regulations of stem cell and stem cell niche, as well as more translational aspects of muscle stem cell and mesenchymal stem cell for use in therapeutic approaches for musculoskeletal aging, neuromuscular diseases, and traumatic injuries. 1. Metabolic regulation of stem cell function 2. Systemic regulation of muscle homeostasis 3. Engineering muscle stem cell niche for regenerative medicine Publications: Lab Site Resources Georgia Tech Resources Offices & Departments News Center Campus Calendar Special Events GreenBuzz Institute CommunicationsVisitor ResourcesCampus Visits Directions to Campus Visitor Parking Information GTvisitor Wireless Network Information Georgia Tech Global Learning Center Georgia Tech Hotel & Conference Center Barnes & Noble at Georgia Tech Ferst Center for the Arts Robert C.
