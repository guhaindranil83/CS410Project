Our goal is to understand the interactions and transformations of molecules at gas-solid and liquid-solid interfaces by creating highly uniform active sites. We use advanced techniques in organometallic and coordination chemistry, surface science, high resolution spectroscopy, isothermal and non-isothermal kinetics, mechanistic analysis and modeling to investigate, design and reengineer heterogeneous catalysts. Our group includes both chemical engineering and chemistry students, working to solve important current problems at the interface of chemistry and reaction engineering. We are working on problems in catalytic olefin metathesis and polymerization, alkane dehydrogenation, biomass upgrading, polymer waste upcycling, and pharmaceutical manufacturing, with particular emphasis on active site structure-function relationships and solvent effects.
