His research expertise lies in the area of Micro and Nano Electronic Mechanical Systems (MEMS/NEMS). He has collaborated with Professor Ali Nayfeh to develop, an accurate, robust, and numerically efficient approach to the modelling and simulation of MEMS and NEMS. Professor Abdel-Rahman has used the modelling technique to analyze and design a wide array of MEMS sensors and transducers such as Radio Frequency (RF) switches, mirrors, filters, and pumps. He is currently working on new filter designs, control strategies for torsional micromirrors, and improving resonant micro-sensors. He is specifically interested in the continued refinement of the modelling and simulation technique, as well as applying it to the design of novel MEMS and NEMS devices for communications and biomedical applications. The biomedical aspect of his work involves applied research in the use of MEMS to build the associated experimental rigs and to design smart prosthetic devices. Wideband Micro Power Generators are also of interest to Professor Abdel-Rahman. He has developed a new class of vibration-based wideband MPGs in collaboration with 2 other UWaterloo professors. Vibration-based MPGs collect energy only from environmental vibrations that lie in a narrow frequency band. His invention replaces a linear oscillator with a nonlinear oscillator as the energy harvesting element of the MPG. Experimental results show that the bandwidth of the new design improves the harvesting bandwidth of "wideband electromagnetic MPGs" by 200-600%. Threshold Mass Sensing is also an area in which Professor Abdel-Rahman holds expertise. He has developed 2 new mass sensing mechanisms that are made of MEMS electrostatic resonators. The sensors detect whether a mass deposited on a sensing platform exceeds a pre-set critical (threshold) value rather than trying to quantify it. The unique feature of these mechanisms is that they eliminate the need for readout electronics. Professor Abdel-Rahman is currently leading efforts to use these mass sensors as platforms to develop vapor/gas and biological sensorsResearch InterestsSensors and ActuatorMicro-electromechanical systemsNano-electromechanical systemsIoTEnergy HarvestingMicro-Power GeneratorsBiomechanicsErgonomicsModeling and simulationVibrations and controlNonlinear SystemsNonlinear DynamicsComplex SystemsBifurcations and ChaosEducation1997, Doctorate, PhD, University of Toledo1991, Master's, MS, University of Toledo1988, Bachelor's, BS, Kuwait UniversityCourses*SYDE 683 -
