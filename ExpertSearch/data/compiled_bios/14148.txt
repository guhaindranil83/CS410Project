Carbon and nutrient biogeochemical cycles. Fate and transport of metals and metalloids in the environment. Biogeochemical kinetics: reactor systems and theory development. Reactive transport modeling. Regional and global up/down scaling of biogeochemical processes. Research PhilippeVanCappellen leads an interdisciplinary research team focussing onthe processes, both natural and human-driven, that control water quality along the hydrological cycle. Understanding these processes is key to assessing and predicting the ecological and biogeochemical consequences of changing climatic, demographic and economic pressures on water resources. Professor Van Cappellen's research includes studies on mineral-water-microbe interactions, groundwater-surface water interactions, modeling reactive transport and geomicrobial reaction systems, biogeochemistry of soils, river-floodplain systems, wetlands, lakes, coastal environments and marine basins, impacts of river damming, agriculture and urbanization on the environmental flows of water, carbon and nutrients, coupled hydrological-biogeochemical modeling, and economic valuation of ecosystem services.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
