He graduated from Nanjing University with a BS in Physics in 1982, and from Brown University with a Ph.D. in Physics in 1998. He joined Yale University in 1987 for post-doctoral training, was appointed as Associate Professor in 1997 and then came to University of Rochester, becoming a tenured full Professor in 2004 in Radiology, Physics and Biomedical Engineering. Dr. Zhong has over 25 years experience in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) physics, engineering and biomedical/clinical/neuroscience applications, with over 130 publications. He is one of the leading researchers for complex relaxation and diffusion effects and interactions of magnetic susceptibility and diffusion in tissues, application of diffusion in brain electrical activities and functions, and is one of the major inventors for intermolecular multiple quantum coherence brain imaging. He also has played leadership roles in international organizations, service in U.S. and international funding reviews and reviewing in leading scientific funding agencies and journals. Dr. Zhong is a grantee of many national and private funds, awardees in research excellence by the NIH, Yale and University of Rochester, and he owns 5 U.S. patents. In recent years, Dr. Zhong's research has focused on brain diffusion tensor imaging, quantitative analysis of brain functional imaging and network analysis, fast MR imaging techniques and their applications of MRI and MRI in neuroscience, translational medicine and individual imaging analysis.CredentialsEducation1982BS | Nanjing University, ChinaPhysics1984MS | Brown UniversityPhysics1988PhD | Brown UniversityPhysicsPost-doctoral Training & Residency09/1987 - 12/1989Postdoctoral Fellow Yale University School of MedicineAwards2004Dean's Award for Excellency in Research, University of Rochester2000Summa Cum Laude Citation, the American Society of Neuroradiology1999Certificate of Merit Citation for Scientific Exhibit, Radiological Society of North America1994The Dean's Award, Yale University School of Medicine1992The FIRST Award, NIH1988 - 1990NIH research fellowship.1982 - 1987China US Physics Examination and Application) scholarship, Brown University.VIEW ALL expand_morePublicationsJournal Articles10/29/2020Du J, Liang P, He H, Tong Q, Gong T, Qian T, Sun Y, Zhong J, Li K.
