Anthony Professor of Geology and Mechanical and Civil Engineering Degrees and Appointments M.E., Ecole Polytechnique, 1987; Ph.D., Institut de Physique du Globe, 1991; Habil., 1992. Professor, Caltech, 2003-11; Earle C. Anthony Professor, 2012-; Director, Tectonic Observatory, 2004-13. Research Group Website Research Overview My research aims mainly at understanding better earthquakes,crustal deformation, and geomorphic processes.We use fieldobservations, seismological and geodetic measurements, remote sensing to developkinematic and dynamic modelsand inform theory.Currently active projects concern: seismicityand mountain building processes in the Himalaya; the imaging and dynamic analysis of seismic (regular earthquakes) and aseismic (slow earthquakes) fault slip; probabilistic forecasting of ground deformation and seismicity, in particular in the context of subsurface engineering operations (for CO2 storage or geothermal energy production for example; the effect of hydrology on crustal deformation and seismicity; ); dune dynamics on Mars and Earth List of Research Areas Geomechanics Seismology Geodesy Remote Sensing MCE News about Jean-Philippe Avouac Aseismic Slip as a Barrier to Earthquake Propagation Read more news about Jean-Philippe Avouac Is this your profile?
