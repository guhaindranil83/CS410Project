Martin Labs: TBD Lab, Navlab Mailing Address Mailing Address Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213 Statement Research Publications Students/Affiliates Statement My specialty ishuman-robot interaction and advanced transportation.I am interested in how to enable timely and appropriate interaction when interfaces are restricted through design, tasks, the environment, time pressures, and/or user abilities. I utilize training and experience in robotics, intelligent transportation, rehabilitation,human factors and ergonomics,human-computer interaction, universal design, and research methods. My two core areas of interest are: Assisting Humans:Advanced technology offers new opportunities for helping people live, work, and travel around their community. Appropriate Robot Behavior:End users expect appropriate robot actions, interventions, and requests for help. I have extensive experience with the design and execution of evaluation experiments for complex human-in-the-loop systems. Examples of past work includes human-machine interaction and interfaces for robots, advanced transportation, machine learning systems, and software agents.
