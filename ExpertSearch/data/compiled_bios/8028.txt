All these courses heavily rely on regular hands-on laboratory exercises with state-of-the-art software and industrial quality equipment that go well beyond typical laboratory experiences. Professor Ehmann also teaches courses at the graduate level. These include: (a) Computer Control in Manufacturing, which emphasizes the use of digital and adaptive control methods for process and motion control in a variety of machine tools and robots; (b) Metal Cutting, in which the mechanics of material removal processes, their stability, and pragmatic implementation are studied; and (c) Micro-manufactuting, which focuses on the emerging field of miniaturization technologies through the consideration of the associated design, processing, and metrology issues.
