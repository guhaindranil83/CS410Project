He also studies graphical models and message-passing algorithms. For more details see personal website. BioMohsen received a BS in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology and a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 2007. His dissertation was on algorithms and models for large-scale networks. During the summers of 2005 and 2006 he interned at IBM Research and Microsoft Research respectively. He was a Postdoctoral Researcher with Microsoft Research from 2007 to 2009 working mainly on applications of machine learning and optimization methods in healthcare and online advertising. In particular, he helped develop a system for predicting hospital patient readmissions and obtained a decision support mechanism for allocating scarce hospital resources to post-discharge care. Their system is currently used in several hospitals across US and Europe. He was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University from 2009 to 2011 with a research focus in high-dimensional statistical learning. In 2011 he joined Stanford University as a faculty, and since 2015 he is an associate professor of Operations, Information, and Technology at Stanford University Graduate School of Business. He was awarded the INFORMS Healthcare Applications Society best paper (Pierskalla) award in 2014 and in 2016, INFORMS Applied Probability Society best paper award in 2015, and National Science Foundation CAREER award.Awards and HonorsYounger Family Faculty Scholar for 20192020Spence Faculty Scholar, 20152016Publications Journal Articles Ensemble Methods for Causal Effects in Panel Data Settings Susan Athey, Mohsen Bayati, Guido W.
