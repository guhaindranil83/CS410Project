He was responsible for supporting lab programs through computational analysis and vibration measurements. His projects ranged from buildings (vibration signature based system identification) to micro-devices (portable bio-pathogen and chemical detectors, accelerometers, adaptive optics arrays) to medical systems (catheter-based device for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms, retinal prosthesis, novel breast cancer imaging system). He has co-patented a carbon-nanotube based acoustic sensor. His primary research interests are in the area of structural dynamics. Current and past projects include energy harvesting devices, grasping landing gear for UAVs, structural health monitoring, and the mechanics of DNA.
