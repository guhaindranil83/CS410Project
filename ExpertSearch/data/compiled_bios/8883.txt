The goal of the marketing faculty is to conduct research that will offer insight into the challenges of marketing and to develop and teach courses that will bring this perspective to students who have come seeking a general management education. Our faculty embraces research traditions grounded in psychology and behavioral decision-making, economics and industrial organization, statistics and management science. These traditions support our research inquiries into consumer behavior, firm behavior, and the development of methods for improving the allocation of marketing resources. Our marketing curriculum is designed to demonstrate to students the implications of these insights for different areas of marketing practice, including branding, pricing, new product development, advertising and marketing communication, channels of distribution, and marketing research.
