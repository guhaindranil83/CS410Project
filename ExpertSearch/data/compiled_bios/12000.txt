He came at Cornell in 2004 after having held a research position in the French CNRS between 1996 and 2003. Website(s) Academia.edu page Overview I study the transformations of religious practices in Late Antiquity. My most recent work deals with early Christian martyr narratives. I published a new collection of texts:Greek and Latin Narratives about the Ancient Martyrs, in the Oxford Early Christian Texts series (2017) and a monograph: The Early Martyr Narratives: Neither Authentic Accounts Nor Forgeries (Divinations: Rereading Late Ancient Religion; University of Pennsylvania Press, 2020). Eighteen prior papers of mine have been translated into English and collected in a volume of the Variorum Collected Studies Series: Transformations of Religious Practices in Late Antiquity (Ashgate 2014). Christians and their Many Identities, which was published by Cornell University Press in 2012, is now available as a paperback. I am a Guggenheim Fellow for 2020-21 and work on a redescription of the triumph of Christianity.
