University ofWisconsin-Madison B.E. (Hons.), BirlaInstitute of Technology & Science-PilaniResearch Interests: Power Electronic Conversion & Control Application of Wide Band-gap Semiconductor Devices Multi-level Converters Renewable Energy Distributed and Sustainable Power Generation and Storage Courses: ECE 4/545 Power Electronic Systems Design I Profile: Dr. Gupta's research focuses on energy conversion with the aim of high power density and efficiency. Ranging from a few kilowatts to several megawatts, the focus applications include electrified transportation, photovoltaic systems, wind farms, micro-grids, etc. Before joining Portland State University in 2020, Dr. Gupta was a part of the Research and Advanced Engineering group at Ford Motor Company where she worked on next-generation electrified powertrains. During her Ph.D., she devised the idea of smart switching modulation for cascaded power converters which permits two orders of reduction in the dc-link capacitance requirements.
