One of the most useful functions of the advisory committee is to provide dialogue between students and practitioners of the profession. The committee structure provides a means for faculty to learn about technical, business, and philosophical trends taking place in industry. Similarly, the committee provides a format in which the department can inform industry about current thinking in academia. EAC meetings are held on campus twice each year.
