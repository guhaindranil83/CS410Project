Honors and Awards National Study of Learning Mindsets Early Career Fellowship Biography Nigel Bosch is an assistant professor in the School of Information Sciences and the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Urbana-Champaign and a faculty affiliate at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and Illinois Informatics. His research includes machine learning/data mining methods to study human behaviors, especially in learning contexts (learning analytics), with an emphasis on model generalization and fair treatment of users. His research examines data such as facial expressions, audio recordings, log file records of user actions, and other sources that provide insight into learners' behaviors. Neural networks and other machine learning methods provide powerful ways to mine these data for knowledge, but can proliferate biases that are commonly found in datasets. Bosch's research also focuses on analyzing the biases in these methods, with the goal of ultimately developing fairer learning software and research methods. He obtained his PhD in computer science at the University of Notre Dame in 2017. For two years prior to joining the iSchool, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the NCSA.
