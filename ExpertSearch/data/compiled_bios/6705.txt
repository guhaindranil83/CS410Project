David Chandler has made seminal contributions to the theory of the liquid state over a 40 year period. These include the highly successful WCA perturbation theory of the thermodynamics of simple liquids, the RISM theory of the structure of molecular liquids, the treatment of chemical equilibria, use of path integral formulations to understand quantum effects in molecular liquids, the treatment of rare events and the concept of importance sampling of trajectory space, and theories of the hydrophobic effect and the glass transition. He is author of the most widely used pedagogical book on statistical mechanics, Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics (Oxford U Press, 1987).
