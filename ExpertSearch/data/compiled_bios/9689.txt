I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Georgia State University and a B.S. degree in computer engineering from Bilkent University. I am currently a research assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science. I am a senior member of the Data Mining Lab (DMLab) at Georgia State University. Our group works on broad areas of data mining and knowledge discovery from solar big data, including computer vision, indexing, data management and integration, deep learning, frequent pattern mining, and time series mining. My research explores the processing, management, and integration of temporal and spatiotemporal data. Presently, I am especially interested in creating data integration and analysis pipelines for heterogeneous large-scale solar data resources. More information about my current projects can be found at my website. Publications B. Aydin and R. A.
