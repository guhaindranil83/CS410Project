From 2000-2003, Dr. Klein served as a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, carrying out theoretical analysis and computer simulations of next-generation semiconductor photonic devices. Dr. Klein first joined Georgia Tech as an ECE faculty member based at the Georgia Tech-Savannah campus in 2003, and in 2012, he transferred to the Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta. Effective January 2018, Dr. Klein was appointed as the School's associate chair for Graduate Affairs.
