Research Weisensees work focuses on understanding the interplay of fluid dynamics, heat transfer and liquid-solid interactions of droplets and other multi-phase systems. Practical applications of interest are phase change heat transfer for thermal management, thermal storage, and water harvesting, metallic additive manufacturing, and droplet interactions with biological and natural systems. Biography Professor Weisensee joined Washington University in St. Louis as an assistant professor in January 2017. She earned a doctorate in mechanical engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in December 2016. Weisensee earned a Diplom-Ingenieur (B.S. + M.S.) in mechanical engineering with high distinction from TU Munich, Germany, in 2013, where she was awarded the Siemens Energy Award for her work on condensing steam bubbles in subcooled flowing water. During her Diplom studies, she was a fellow of the German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes). Weisensee also holds a masters in materials sciences from UIUC (2011).
