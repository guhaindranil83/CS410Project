B. van Dover Walter S. Carpenter, Jr. Professor of Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Bard Hall, Room 227 607/255-3228 College of Engineering vandover@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyR. Bruce van Dover received his Ph.D. degree (1980) in Applied Physics from Stanford University following a B.S. degree (1974) in Electrical Engineering/Engineering Physics from Princeton University. He then joined Bell Laboratories, (Murray Hill, NJ) where he conducted basic research in the science and technology of superconducting, magnetic, and electronic materials and devices. In 2002 he joined Cornell University as a Professor of Materials Science and Engineering to more fully engage his interest in undergraduate and graduate education He has been highly productive during his career with over 250 research publications, book chapters, and encyclopedia articles, and 69 US and foreign Patents. He has lectured on these materials in Europe, Japan, and across the US at many universities and topical conferences, as well as for general audiences. His leadership role is evidenced by the over 13,000 citations to his work, with an h-index of 50 (i.e., 50 publications with at least 50 citations). His research currently focusses on synthesis and characterization of thin films, developing and using high-throughput techniques for the discovery of ionic conductors, fuel cell catalysts and other energy-related materials. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and a Fellow of the American Physical Society.Research Interests* UHF properties of magnetic thin films * Synthesis and characterization of novel optical materials (nonlinear materials, thin film gain media, etc.) * Characterization of nanometer-scale materials: superconductors, dielectrics, and magnetic materials * Electronic phase diagrams determined by induced surface charges rather than chemical doping * Composition-spread approach to parallelized synthesis/characterization of materials, including novel catalysts for direct-methanol fuel cell anodes.Advanced MaterialsEnergy SystemsSelected PublicationsLeBras, R., R.
