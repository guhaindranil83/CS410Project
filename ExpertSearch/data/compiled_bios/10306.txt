I was involved in the leadership of two broadly partnered programs supported by the DOE and the State of New Mexico: 1) The New Mexico Hydrogen Initiative is building research infrastructure, supporting R&D, and developing an educational pipeline to advance hydrogen as an alternative fuel and 2) The Grid Reliability & Distributed Energy Research Program is exploring the impact of alternative energy resources distributed on the electrical grid. This program is developing the electrical grid in Playas, NM to be used as a test-bed for the integration of distributed energy resources and control platforms. Plasma Polymer Surface Modification: My other specific research projects are focused on the use of plasma polymerization and plasma treatments to modify the surfaces of engineering materials. Specific research projects include the plasma synthesis of thin-films for sensors, barrier layers, novel membranes, fuel cells, and nano-scale coatings on the surfaces of particles. My research is and has been supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Sandia National Labs Microsensors Group, and Los Alamos National Lab. In the picture above, Anurag Pandey is depositing a plasma polymer film using one of our RF-Plasma Reactors. In the upper right hand corner, there is a cross section of a composite membrane consisting of a thin plasma SiOx separating layer on a ceramic microporous substrate. In the lower left, a plasma polymer microsensor array for detection of trace chemicals in the environment. The pink glow of the tumbling RF-plasma reactor for nano-scale conformal particle coating is shown in the lower right. Patents D.H. Weinkauf and C.E.
