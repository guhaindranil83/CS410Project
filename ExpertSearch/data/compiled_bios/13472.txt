Combining both experiments and theory, he investigates problems such as how drops spread on surfaces and how bubbles pop. His research is motivated by problems in a variety of fields, including healthcare(e.g. virus transfer via droplets), energy (e.g. boiling and condensation), and materials (e.g. foams).
