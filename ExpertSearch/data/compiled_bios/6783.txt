Solutions of locally-applicable equations with appropriate boundary conditions produce simulations of processes of industrial interest. Computer models describe system response for process simulation, control, and optimization. Computer graphics give visual confirmation of the calculations. Areas of interest include practical applications of nucleation and growth, phase transformations, reaction kinetics, solidification, and corrosion.
