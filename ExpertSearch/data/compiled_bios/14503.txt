Professor Ioannidis and his students research fundamental aspects of multiphase flow and transport of solutes and nanoparticles in porous materials of different kinds (fibrous or granular, loose or consolidated, natural or man-made, etc.). The ultimate goal of their research is to enable engineering applications ranging from contaminant hydrology, groundwater remediation and petroleum production to environmental sampling, fuel cell performance optimization and oil spill response.Research InterestsCapillarity and Wetting Colloids and InterfacesNanoparticles Porous Media Multiphysics Characterization and Modelling of the Porous Microstructure Groundwater RemediationEducation1993, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo1989, Bachelor of Applied Science, Chemical Engineering, University of PatrasCourses*CHE 398 - Directed Research ProjectTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 100 - Chemical Engineering Concepts 1Taught in 2015CHE 298 - Directed Research ProjectTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 614 - Capillary and Transport Phenomena in Porous MediaTaught in 2015NE 201 - Nanotoxicology; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2015CHE 101 - Chemical Engineering Concepts 2Taught in 2016CHE 399 - Directed Research ProjectTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 299 - Directed Research ProjectTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 202 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019BME 384 - Biomedical Transport: Biofluids and Mass TransferTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 102 - Chemistry for EngineersTaught in 2017CHE 201 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 302 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 499 - Elective Research ProjectTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019NE 101 - Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2017CHE 402 - SeminarTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019NE 102 - Introduction to Nanomaterials Health Risk; Nanotechnology Engineering PracticeTaught in 2018CHE 498 - Directed Research ProjectTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 610 - Theory and Application of Transport PhenomenaTaught in 2018CHE 301 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 312 - Mathematics of Heat and Mass TransferTaught in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019CHE 483 - Group Design ProjectTaught in 2019CHE 401 - SeminarTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019CHE 514 - Fundamentals of Petroleum ProductionTaught in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsGhanbarian, Behzad and Ioannidis, Marios A and Hunt, Allen G, Theoretical Insight Into the Empirical Tortuosity-Connectivity Factor in the Burdine-Brooks-Corey Water Relative Permeability Model, Water Resources Research, 2017Salim, F and Ioannidis, M and Grecki, T, Experimentally validated mathematical model of analyte uptake by permeation passive samplers, Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts, 19(11), 2017, 1363 - 1373Walton, Kenneth M and Unger, Andre JA and Ioannidis, Marios A and Parker, Beth L, Impact of eliminating fracture intersection nodes in multiphase compositional flow simulation, Water Resources Research, 53(4), 2017, 2917 - 2939Bizmark, Navid and Ioannidis, Marios A, Ethyl Cellulose Nanoparticles at the Alkane--Water Interface and the Making of Pickering Emulsions, Langmuir, 33(40), 2017, 10568 - 10576Han, Yining and Bizmark, Navid and Abukhdeir, Nasser Mohieddin and Ioannidis, Marios A, Dynamics of ethyl cellulose nanoparticle self-assembly at the interface of a nematic liquid crystal droplet, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 19(36), 2017, 24955 - 24960Grove, Jason and Ioannidis, Marios and Wright, Derek, DESCRIBING AND MEASURING THE ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE BASED USING CONCEPT DOMAINS, Proceedings of the Canadian Engineering Education Association (CEEA), 06 2017 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 6(E6) Phone:519-888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Chemical Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
