His research interests include electrochemical engineering, fuel cells, batteries, nanotechnology and materials science. In the area of electrochemical engineering, Professor Pritzker and his team for many years has investigated the use of direct current and pulse plating for electrodeposition of metal (Cu, Co, Ni) and alloy (Co-Ni, Fe-Ni) coatings. Their work involves experimental studies and mathematical modelling of deposit morphology, electrode response, surface properties and electrode reaction kinetics for applications such as corrosion protection and fabrication of electronic devices and components. He has also recently collaborated with a colleague Professor Nasser Abukhdeir on the use of atomistic simulation methods such as kinetic Monte Carlo techniques to investigate fundamental aspects of the dynamics of copper electrodeposition and the evolution of the coating microstructure. For a number of years, Professor Pritzker has also collaborated with colleagues Professor Michael Fowler and Zhongwei Chen, in the Chemical Engineering Department on several research projects concerned with polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFC) and lithium-ion batteries. These include the development of novel Pt-based catalysts for PEMFCs, study of the degradation and evolution of defects in the catalyst layer of PEMFCs and the detailed investigation of the behaviour of lithium iron phosphate electrodes during the charge and discharge of lithium-ion batteries. Professor Pritzker is also conducting research with another colleague Professor Yuning Li on the development of an all-inorganic oxide solar cell. He has also continued his collaboration with Professor Pu Chen, also of the Chemical Engineering Department, aimed at developing nanomaterials based on self-assembling oligopeptides for applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and biosensors. A recent project was aimed at combining these oligopeptides with normally hydrophobic carbon nanotubes in order to disperse them in aqueous solutions and to form novel hybrid hydrogels with very useful properties. Several of these research projects are being conducted with industry research partners such as BlackBerry and Automotive Fuel Cell Cooperation Corporation.Research InterestsElectrochemical EngineeringMetal and Alloy ElectrodepositionPolymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)NanotechnologyProcess Systems EngineeringSeparation ProcessesOriented Strand Board ManufacturingGreen Reaction EngineeringInterfacial PhenomenaColloids & Porous MediaWaterEducation1985, Doctorate, PhD, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University1978, Master's, MS, University of California, Berkeley1976, Bachelor's, BEng, McGill UniversityCourses*CHE 574 - Industrial Wastewater Pollution ControlTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 674 - Industrial Waste TreatmentTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 775 - Research Topics in Environmental Engineering and Pollution ControlTaught in 2016CHE 331 - Electrochemical EngineeringTaught in 2015, 2016CHE 620 - Applied Engineering MathematicsTaught in 2017CHE 231 - Physical Chemistry 2Taught in 2015, 2018* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsAmini, Kiana and Pritzker, Mark D, In situ polarization study of zinc--cerium redox flow batteries, Journal of Power Sources, 471, 2020Amini, Kiana and Gostick, Jeff and Pritzker, Mark D, Metal and Metal Oxide Electrocatalysts for Redox Flow Batteries, Advanced Functional Materials, 2020Amini, Kiana and Pritzker, Mark D, Improvement of zinc-cerium redox flow batteries using mixed methanesulfonate-chloride negative electrolyte, Applied Energy, 255, 2019Yang, Yiyi and Pritzker, Mark and Li, Yuning, Electrodeposited p-type Cu2O thin films at high pH for all-oxide solar cells with improved performance, Thin Solid Films, 676, 2019, 42 - 53Hoque, Md Ariful and Hassan, Fathy M and Jauhar, Altamash M and Jiang, Gaopeng and Pritzker, Mark and Choi, Ja-Yeon and Knights, Shanna and Ye, Siyu and Chen, Zhongwei, Web-Like 3D architecture of pt nanowires and sulfur-doped carbon nanotube with superior electrocatalytic performance, ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering, 6(1), 2018, 93 - 98Mao, Z and Farkhondeh, M and Pritzker, M and Fowler, M and Chen, Z, Calendar Aging and Gas Generation in Commercial Graphite/NMC-LMO Lithium-Ion Pouch Cell, Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 164(14), 2017Farkhondeh, M and Pritzker, M and Fowler, M and Delacourt, C, Mesoscopic Modeling of a LiFePO4 Electrode: Experimental Validation under Continuous and Intermittent Operating Conditions, Journal of The Electrochemical Society, 164(11), 2017Farkhondeh, M and Pritzker, M and Delacourt, C and Liu, SS-W and Fowler, M, Method of the Four-Electrode Electrochemical Cell for the Characterization of Concentrated Binary Electrolytes: Theory and Application, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 121(8), 2017, 4112 - 4129 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 6(E6) Phone:519-888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Chemical Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
