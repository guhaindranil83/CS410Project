FacultySep 03, 2020Fang and Koppes Receive $2.2M NIH Award Leading to State-of-the-Art Electrophysiological CapabilitiesECE Assistant Professor Hui Fang (PI) and ChE Assistant Professor Ryan Koppes (co-PI), in collaboration with UCLA and Boston Childrens Hospital, received a $2.2M NIH grant for Novel transparent, ultra-soft neuroelectrode arrays based on nanomeshing conventional electrode materials. In this study, they propose to prove a novel electrode concept, nanomeshing conventional electrode materials, can lead to state-of-the-art electrophysiological capabilities while allowing at the same time, optical and chronic-bio- compatibilities. Besides enabling new hypothesis-driven neuroscience studies from overcoming major barriers of integrating in-vivo electrical recordings with optical approaches, the proposed research will also provide unique opportunities for next-generation therapeutic interventions via sustainable neural prosthetics. FacultyAug 23, 2019Fang Awarded NSF Grant to Study Stretchable SiliconThe practical use for stretchable silicon might not seem immediately obvious to the average person, but Hui Fang, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, says there are a number of useful applications for electronics with elasticity. Fang is the principal investigator of a $470K National Science Foundation (NSF) grant in collaboration with Oklahoma State [] FacultyAug 23, 2019Fang Awarded NIH Grant to Enable Ultra-Large-Scale Brain Mapping CapabilityAssistant Professor Hui Fang, electrical and computer engineering, says that in order to truly understand the human brain, researchers need to be able to map much larger areas of the electrical activities in the brain than whats currently possible. Given how complex the brain is, just examining a small region isnt enough to truly grasp [] FacultyDec 18, 2018Assistant Professor Fang Awarded NSF CAREERECE Assistant Professor Hui Fang has been awarded a $500K NSF CAREER Award for his Transforming Neural Interfaces Using Stretchable, Transparent, Multifunctional Nanomesh Microelectrodes project. The award starts in 2019 and will run for five years.
