Epstein Bio B.S. in Physics, University of Rochester, 1988M.S. in Engineering Physics, University of Virginia, 1990Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering, University of Virginia, 1993Post-Doc in Radiology, University of Virginia, 1994 "Our lab develops new MRI methods for imaging the heart. Some of our methods are used world-wide for clinical imaging or research studies." Frederick H. Epstein, Mac Wade Professor of Biomedical Engineering Dr. Epstein is recognized for his contributions to the field of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. He has been a world leader in advancing MRI myocardial strain imaging by developing and applying the cine DENSE (displacement encoding using stimulated echoes) MRI method. He has also made important contributions to accelerated MRI methods and to methods and applications of preclinical MRI in mouse models of heart disease. Dr. Epsteinhas chaired the Science Committee of the Society for Cardiovascular MRI (SCMR) (2008) and the ISMRM Cardiac Study Group (2009). He served as an ad hoc member of the NIH NIBIB Board of Scientific Counselors in 2012 and as an international reviewer for the South African Medical Research Council 5-year review of the University of Cape Town Medical Imaging Research Unit (2010). He was recently a member of the Board of Trustees for the SCMR (2013-2015), and he recently served as a standing member of the NIH Study Section Biomedical Imaging Technology A (2012-2016). He is currently a Deputy Editor for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2011 present, the leading technical journal devoted to MRI physics and engineering), and is a member of the American Heart Association Mid-Atlantic Affiliate Research Committee (2014-2017). Dr. Epstein was the only biomedical engineer invited to speak at the American College of Cardiology Think Tank on the future of cardiac imaging in Washington, DC in 2015. Dr. Epstein is also presently the elected Chair of the American Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering (AIMBE) Academic Council, a group comprised of all BME Department Chairs across the nation. For contributions to research and service, Dr. Epstein is an elected Fellow of three major societies, namely the ISMRM (2013), the American Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering (2014), and the American Heart Association (2014). Awards Distinguished Investigator Award from the Academy for Radiology & Biomedical Imaging Research Fellow and Established Investigator Award of the American Heart Association (AHA) Fellow of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) Research Interests Biomedical and Molecular Imaging Image Reconstruction and Processing Imaging System Engineering Cardiovascular Disease In the News Professor and Chair of Biomedical Engineering Wins Distinguished Investigator Award Professor and Chair of Biomedical Engineering Wins Distinguished Investigator Award Dr. Epstein Recognized for Cutting Edge Imaging Research The Academy for Radiology & Biomedical Imaging Research has honored Fred Epstein, PhD, for contributions to biomedical imaging research.
