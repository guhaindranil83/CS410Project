Wayne Bequette Professor and Technology Manager, CESMII Northern Regional Manufacturing Center Chemical and Biological Engineering bequeb@rpi.edu http://homepages.rpi.edu/~bequeb/bwbres.html B. Wayne Bequette is a Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering and the Technology Manager for the Northern Regional Center of the Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. His research efforts are focused on the modeling and control of biomedical and chemical process systems. Professor Bequette is the author of over 100 refereed journal publications and two textbooks published by Prentice Hall (i) Process Control: Modeling, Design and Simulation (2003), and (ii) Process Dynamics: Modeling, Analysis and Simulation (1998). He serves as Board Secretary for the American Automatic Control Council and President of the Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering Corporation. Dr. Bequette is a founding member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, and serves on the Editorial Board of Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research. He is a Fellow of IEEE, AIChE and the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineers, and was inducted into the Arkansas Academy of Chemical Engineers. He is an avid bicyclist (commuting to campus in upstate NY throughout the entire year) and pole-vaulter (Masters level competition refers more to age than skill level). Education 1980 B.S. Ch.E.
