Jin received his B.A. in Integrated Science and B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering from Northwestern University. Afterward, Jin went to obtain his Sc.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from MIT, where his research focused on finding a structure-property relation that controls the electrochemical activity of transition metal oxides and nanoparticles for fuel cells, electrolyzers, and metal-air batteries. Jin conducted his postdoctoral fellowship at the Harvard University Center for the Environment. There, he worked on understanding the light-matter interaction in titanium oxides and the role of non-equilibrium structure on the surface chemistry and the carrier lifetimes. His interest is in developing rational strategies for designing new materials for energy and environmental applications.jsuntivich@cornell.eduAssociate Professor Chekesha M. Watson Director of Undergraduate StudiesChekesha Liddell received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry with Highest Distinction from Spelman College (1999) and a Bachelor of Materials Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology (1999), [Atlanta University Center, Dual Degree Engineering Program]. She was awarded the NASA Women in Science and Engineering Scholarship to support her undergraduate work including an honors thesis on the Synthesis and Characterization of m-Aminobenzenarsonic acid, an important standard for understanding the metabolysis of arsenic in poultry. Liddell also held three internship appointments at NASA, Kennedy Space Center in the Cryogenics and External Tank Branch and the Microchemical Analysis Laboratories. She joined the Cornell University faculty in November of 2003, after receiving a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering with a minor in Science and Technology Policy from Georgia Tech. Liddell's awards for scholarly achievement include the National Science Foundation (NSF) Career Award [Nonspherical, Active, and "Inverted" Bases for Optimized Photonic Crystal Design] (2006); Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Sciences Career Initiation Grant, (2003); Office of Naval Research Graduate Fellowship (1999-2003); Georgia Tech President's Fellowship, (1999-2003); Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Sciences Fellowship (1999-2003); NSBE, National Society of Black Engineers Fellow, (2000); Hertz Foundation Fellowship Grant, (1999); TMS materials society, J. Keith Brimacombe Presidential Scholarship, (1999); ASM Foundation Scholarship, ASM International materials society, (1998); and the ASTM, American Society for Testing and Materials, Mary R. Norton Memorial Fellowship, (1999). Liddell is a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the American Chemical Society, the Materials Research Society, the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR) and the Cornell Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS).cml66@cornell.eduAssociate Professor Shefford BakerDirector of MSE MEng ProgramShefford P. Baker received his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at Stanford University, in 1993, was a staff scientist at the Max-Planck-Institut fr Metallforschung in Stuttgart from 1993 to 1997 and joined the Cornell faculty in 1998. He was Visiting Professor at the Facult des Sciences et Techniques de Saint Jrome, Universit Paul Czanne, Marseille, in summer 2006. Baker has received several teaching awards at Cornell, is on the faculty in Materials Science and Engineering at Cornell University. His research focuses on the mechanical properties of materials, particularly those having critical length scales in the nanometer regime. His interests include relating processing to structure, defects, and stresses in thin films, including texture and phase transformations; nanocontact mechanics; nanomechanical behavior of mineralized tissues, plastic deformation and hardness of silicate and metallic glasses. In addition to his current role as director of the MSE MEng program, Baker has served as the Director of Undergraduate Studies and as co-Director of the Biomaterials Program at Cornell and as President of the Materials Research Society.SPB14@cornell.eduAmie J. PrinceDirector of AdministrationAmie Prince has joined Cornell as the Director of Administration for the Materials Science and Engineering department. She comes from the Cornell Office of Sponsored Programs where Amie worked with faculty and staff on identifying, evaluating, negotiating, and coordinating funded research projects across various academic disciplines. She concurrently served as the Manager of Export Controls in the Office of the Vice Provost for Research developing and implementing policies and procedures for the university-wide export compliance program. Amie is an elected Town Councilor in Summerhill, NY, where she has successfully proposed and implemented legislation and raised funds for municipal projects such as access to broadband Internet in rural areas. Prior to coming to Cornell, Amie led research teams at corporations such as Advion BioSciences and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Amie holds a Bachelor's degree in Biology from Alfred University, as well as an Associate's degree in Humanities from Onondaga Community College, and is certified in U.S. export control regulations, specifically EAR & ITAR.ajp246@cornell.edu NewsEventsSpotlightsStaff DirectoryAbout UsContact UsDirections and MapsIntranetAdmissions:607 255-9617DEPT Address:210 Bard Hall Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853-1501Connect with usFacebookTwitterYoutubeLinkedInCopyright 2020 Cornell University All rights reserved.Web Accessibility Assistance
