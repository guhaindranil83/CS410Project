Des Marais Gale Assistant Professor Research Interests: Plant ecology and evolution, physiology, functional genomics, sustainable agriculture, plant-water relations ConnectMIT Room 48-325 15 Vassar Street Cambridge, MA, 02139 Office Telephone:617.258.6482 Lab Telephone:617.258.6588 Email: dldesmar@mit.edu Assistant:Lumidi Campbell /lumidi@mit.edu Research Website:https://desmaraislab.scripts.mit.edu/lab/home/ Education BA,Integrative Biology, UC Berkeley, 2000 PhD, Biology, Duke University, 2008 Research InterestsThe primary focus of research in the Des Marais Lab is to understand the mechanisms of plant-environment interaction. We use tools from molecular, quantitative, and population genetics to identify the physiological basis of plant response to environmental cues, and ask how these mechanisms constrain or facilitate plant breeding and evolutionary change.
