Manufacturing Systems Eng., University of Wisconsin-Madison, Waterloo, WI B.S. Electical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OHResearch InterestsAs a design engineer in the automotive parts industry, I found that an engineer's job depends on the ability to efficiently collect and analyze data. Since many engineers have limited access to statistical methods, my research is to develop simple-to-use, yet statistically powerful tools for the design and analysis of both physical and simulation-based experiments. I have recently been involved with research on adapting design of experiment techniques for use in simulation experiments. These experiments are run on simulation models of manufacturing or other large scale systems and help engineers and managers to make tactical and strategic decisions based on realistic computer models. Since I view statistical methods as tools to be used for a purpose, I am concerned with the entire process of design, development, and continuous improvement in industry. These broader interests have led to my directorship in the Segal Design Institute. In Segal, I direct all undergraduate education programs which focus on the full design process with special attention to meeting human needs with technology.Selected PublicationsErickson, Collin B.; Ankenman, Bruce E.; Plumlee, Matthew; Sanchez, Susan M., Gradient based criteria for sequential design, WSC 2018 - 2018 Winter Simulation ConferenceLane, Jacqueline Ng; Ankenman, Bruce E; Iravani, Seyed MR, Insight into gender differences in higher education, Service ScienceDuan, Weitao; Ankenman, Bruce E.; Sanchez, Susan M.; Sanchez, Paul J., Sliced Full Factorial-Based Latin Hypercube Designs as a Framework for a Batch Sequential Design Algorithm, TechnometricsErickson, Collin; Ankenman, Bruce E.; Sanchez, Susan M., Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software, 2016 Winter Simulation Conference BACK TO TOP Northwestern SealMcCormick School of Engineering, Northwestern UniversityTechnological Institute, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208view all contact infoAdmissionsFaculty DirectoryGive to McCormickTech Room Finder / MapsEmergency InformationNorthwestern HomeTech Lost and FoundMcCormick on twitterMcCormick on facebookMcCormick on linkedinMcCormick on rssMcCormick on youtube 2020Robert R.
