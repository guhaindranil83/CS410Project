Respondus LockDown Browser prevents students from opening other applications during a Canvas exam, but it is best suited for use with assessments given on-site in conjunction with human proctors.Respondus MonitorAn add-on to Respondus LockDown Browser that requires students to use a webcam to monitor their testing environment. Respondus Monitor builds upon the power of LockDown Browser, using a students webcam and industry-leading video analytics to prevent cheating during non-proctored exams. A students environment is recorded for the duration of the exam and an artificial intelligence engine performs several layers of analysis to identify and flag suspicious activity which can be reviewed and assessed by faculty. LockDown Monitor is recommended for the proctoring of remote courses that do not have the aid of live human proctors.Requesting Access for Respondus Lockdown Browser and Respondus MonitorTo request access to Respondus Lockdown Browser and Monitor please complete and submit the following form with the subject line of "Respondus Lockdown Browser Only" or "Respondus Monitor" to indicate which application you would like enabled for your course.Request Respondus Lockdown Browser and Monitor and Lockdown Monitor For Your Course (For Faculty Only)Please Note: You may also submit a request via email at nursing-help@umich.edu with the subject line of "Respondus Lockdown Browser Only" or "Respondus Monitor" to indicate which application you would like enabled for your course.Request Respondus Lockdown Browser and Monitor For Your Course (For Faculty Only)Once your request is received, if this is your first time using Respondus Lockdown Browser and Monitor, a consultation appointment will be scheduled, after which you will be given access for your course.
