D. in Electrical Engineering (with specialization in computer engineering) from the Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia in 1992. He worked as an application and senior software engineer for Integrated Systems, Inc. (acquired by WindRiver Systems, Inc in late 90s) of Santa Clara, California between 1992 and 1993. He joined the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Toledo as a faculty member in 1993. He has been serving as a faculty member with the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Toledo. Recent Publications J. Li, and G.
