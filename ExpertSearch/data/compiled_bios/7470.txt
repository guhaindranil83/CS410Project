He is also affiliated with the Division of Systems Engineering. Prof. Saligrama is interested in problems arising in machine learning, statistical signal processing, and control & information theory. His recent research activities include machine learning under budget constraints, information theoretic bounds for recovery of sparse phenomena, and anomaly detection on graphs and topic modeling. Another focus of his recent research is on developing concepts and tools for video analytics in highly cluttered and urban scenarios. This includes search and retrieval problems in large video datasets as well as algorithms for real-time anomaly detection.
