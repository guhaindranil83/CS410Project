My research findings have always been published in international journals of high repute and in conferences held both in India and abroad. Post Ph.D., I joined the Structure and Fatigue COE, R&D of Honeywell Technology Solutions, India as Tech Lead responsible for the design and development of automotive components operating at high temperature and aggressive environment. I was focal for many critical customerssuch as AUDI, Volkswagen, John Deer, Daimler etc. in solving crack issues arising due to Thermo-mechanical fatigue. My efforts have always been appreciated in supporting them technically. Having been in research (MS+PhD) for 6 years and post PhD in Industry for 3 years, I have decided to continue my research and teach latest technology to the young engineers. I have joined BITS-Pilani as assistant professor in the dept. of Mechanical Engineering.
