He joined the faculty of the Georgia Institute of Technology in September 2007 and was appointed to the Joseph M. Pettit Professorship in 2018. Dr. Mukhopadhyay worked at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, N.Y. as research staff member from August 2006 to September 2007 and as an intern in summers of 2003, 2004, and 2005. At IBM, his research primarily focused on technology-circuit co-design methodologies for low-power and variation tolerant static random access memory (SRAM) in sub-65nm silicon technologies. Dr. Mukhopadhyay has (co)-authored over 250 papers in reputed conferences and journals and filed four United States patents. He is a Fellow of the IEEE Research interests: Low-power, variation tolerant, and reliable VLSI systems Device/circuit level modeling/estimation of power, yield, and reliability Technology-circuit co-design methodologies Self-adaptive systems with on-chip sensing and repair technique Memory design for VLSI applications Ultra-low power and fault-tolerant nanoelectronics: technology, circuit, and computing platforms Distinctions: IEEE Fellow, 2018 Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Award, 2012 ECE Outstanding Junior Faculty Member Award, 2012 Class of 1934 Course Survey Teaching Effectiveness Award, 2012 National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award, 2011 IBM Faculty Award, 2009 and 2010 SRC Inventor Recognition Award, 2008 IBM Ph.D. Fellowship award in 2004-2005 2005 SRC Technical Excellence award as a member of the Purdue University research group Best paper awards at IEEE-Nano 2003 and ICCD 2004, Best paper in session award at TECHCON-2005 S.
