The team used specially textured mesh that make bubbles collapse as fast as they form. READ MORE A new way to make droplets bounce away The Varanasi Research Group has developed a new approach to minimize the contact between droplets and surfaces, potentially preventing icing or soaking. READ MORE New surface treatment could improve refrigeration efficiency A new surface treatment developed by the Varanasi Research Group could be used to improve refrigeration efficiency by promoting droplet formation and facilitating heat transfer.
