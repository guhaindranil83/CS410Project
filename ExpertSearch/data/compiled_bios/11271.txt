Most ocean remote sensing and communications methods rely on acoustic signals (sonar) due to the poor propagation characteristics of electromagnetic signals. One area of his research is focused on using random background noise (e.g., from breaking wave sounds) for remote sensing. The breaking wave noise is a kind of acoustic overhead "lighting" that can be used for imaging. Another area of research involves using sounds from marine mammals, such as whale calls, to determine species type and population density. The sensors and signal processing for these ocean acoustic applications are being developed for deployment on a variety of autonomous underwater vehicles which allows for extensive measurements at a relative low cost.
