He was with KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, as Assistant 2010-2013), and Associate Professor (Tenured) and Docent (2013-2017/August); where he lead the SmarTS Lab and research group. He also worked at Statnett SF, the Norwegian electric power transmission system operator, as consultant (2011 - 2012), and Special Advisor in R&D (2013 - 2016). He joined Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in August 2017, to continue to develop his research and laboratory, ALSETLab. His research focuses on "electrified systems" (e.g. from power grids to electrified aircraft), developing cyber-physical models for stability analysis and control design, measurement data-based methods for analysis and control (including machine learning), and the implementation and testing of software tools and hardware prototypes. His research interests are in the area of cyber-physical system modeling, simulation, stability and control; with applications to power and energy systems, power electronics and more recently, transport electrification, including hybrid-electric propulsion for aircraft and electrical vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL).
