Benjamin Professor of Behavioral Economics and Genoeconomics In my research, I expand the boundaries of economics for example, by quantitatively measuring a persons well-being and using genomic data to enhance our understanding of behavior. Areas of Expertise: Behavioral Economics Genoeconomics About Biography Publications Biography Daniel Benjamin is a tenured professor with joint appointments at the UCLA Anderson School of Management and the Human Genetics Department at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. He is a co-founder and co-director of the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, a multidisciplinary enterprise that provides a platform for collaboration between geneticists and social scientists. Benjamins background is in behavioral economics, where his research incorporates ideas and methods from psychology into economic analysis. His research on genoeconomics develops tools for incorporating genomic data into the social sciences. Benjamins research topics include: understanding errors people make in statistical reasoning; exploring how best to use survey measures of subjective well-being (such as happiness and life satisfaction) to track national well-being and evaluate policies; and identifying genetic variants associated with outcomes such as educational attainment and subjective well-being. His earlier work addressed how economic behavior relates to cognitive ability and social identity (ethnicity, race, gender and religion). Prior to joining UCLA, Benjamin was a faculty member at Cornell University and at the University of Southern California. He earned his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University.
