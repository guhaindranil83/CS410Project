The research will aim to explore light-induced control of solid materials of reduced dimensionality. The unique electronic, magnetic and photonic properties will provide novel platforms for next-generation information processing, light processing, and quantum devices. Fang Liu has been DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) postdoctoral fellow and MRSEC postdoctoral fellow in the group of Prof. Xiaoyang Zhu at Columbia University. Her postdoctoral research focused on preparation of macroscopic 2D materials and exploring their ultrafast light induced dynamics. Prior to working in Columbia, she completed her Ph.D under the direction of Prof. Marsha I Lester at University of Pennsylvania. In her Ph.D work, she used time resolved spectroscopic techniques to study spectroscopy and photochemistry of Criegee intermediates, a species important in atmospheric chemistry. She received her B.S. in chemistry at Peking University in 2010. Research Summary The group will develop scalable and controllable processes to produce low dimensional materials and their artificial structures, and unravel their novel static and dynamical properties of broad interest to future photonic, electronic and energy technologies. The topics will include: a) Unraveling time-resolved dynamics in light-induced electronic response of two dimensional (2D) materials artificial structures. b) Fabrication of 1D atomically thin nanoribbon arrays and characterization of the electronic and magnetic properties for the prominent edge states. c) Lightwave manipulation with 2D superlattices. These research projects will provide participating students with broad interdisciplinary training across physics, chemistry, and materials science.
