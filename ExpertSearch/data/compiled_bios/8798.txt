In the Department of Mechanical Engineering, many of our undergraduate students work side-by-side with faculty and graduate students on innovative, pioneering research. By working in the hands-on environment of mechanical engineering research, students have an opportunity to apply their classroom knowledge to real-world problems. Our undergraduates often present the results of their research at regional and national conferencesand the department has a long tradition of student recognition and awards for outstanding research projects. In addition, undergraduate research provides an excellent foundation for future graduate work, which is why every year some of our top graduates elect to pursue a Master's or Ph.D. degree at UK or other outstanding universities throughout the country.
