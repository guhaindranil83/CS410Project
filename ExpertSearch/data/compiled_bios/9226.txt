Bettadpur Associate Professor Director, Center for Space Research Fellow of the FSX Professorship in Space Application and Exploration Department Research Areas: Orbital Mechanics Education:Ph.D., The University of Texas at Austin Research Interests: Orbital Mechanics, Perturbations, and Orbit Determination Space Geodesy (Earth's Shape, Orientation & Gravity Field) Modeling, Determination and Interpretation of Gravity Field Space Mission Design Data Processing and Numerical Methods The Earth is very dynamical object - its shape, orientation and mass distribution change on time-scales of days to millenia, driven by physical process in the ocean, the atmosphere, the ice and in the solid Earth. These dynamical processes can be studied from space, using radiometric and laser measurements, together with sophisticated models for the orbital motion of artificial satellites. Dr. Bettadpur's core interests are the design and architecture of space missions for this purpose; the analysis of space geodetic data; and the interpretation of the results. Dr. Bettadpur holds an appointment as well in the Department of Geological Sciences in the Jackson School of Geosciences, and is an affiliate of the UT Applied Research Laboratory. He is an Associate Fellow of the AIAA, and a Fellow of the IAG.
