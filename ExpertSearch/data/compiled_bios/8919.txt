CASI fosters broad engagement and interdisciplinary collaborations across academic and social silos. We seek to question commonly held assumptions about the role of corporations in our society, as well as broaden and deepen the conversation with multiple stakeholders and perspectives. We work with students, faculty, alumni, the broader Stanford community, and key business and policy decision-makers to support teaching, research, events, and civic engagement.
