Okwudire and Johnsen receive ME Department Achievement Awards01/23/2017 Okwudire and Johnsen will be honored at the ME Spring Banquet Student Spotlight: Marc Henry de Frahan02/08/2016 Marc works on many of the current limitations that prevent scientists from achieving fusion. Broadly applied, this research falls under fluid dynamics. Former ME Student's article featured as the cover of the Journal of Applied Physics11/17/2015 His article was titled "Helium atmospheric pressure plasma jets touching dielectric and metal surfaces" ME student's research featured on cover of the Journal of Applied Physics09/09/2015 ME graduate student Marc Henry de Frahan, lead author of the paper, began conducting this research as a summer student with LLNLs NIF and Photon Science Directorate Two of Johnsen's students win Student Paper Awards09/03/2015 Lauren Mancia placed third in the Biomedical Acoustics Student Paper Award and Marc Henry de Frahan placed third in the CFD Student Paper Competition Pagination Next page Mechanical Engineering Homepage G.G.
