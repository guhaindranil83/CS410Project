My research has predominantly focused on sensor-based movement analysis in combination with appropriate signal analysis, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence techniques. Predominantly, my research areas of interests are: (1) using biomechanics and wearable-sensor for monitoring and assessing human movement with a focus on fall risk assessments and (2) analyzing naturalistic driving patterns with a focus on older adult driving safety and big data sets.Research InterestsBiomedical engineering Clinical engineeringRehabilitation engineeringGait analysisWearable sensorsInertial sensorsForce and pressure sensorsMachine learningFall risk assessmentNaturalistic drivingDriving fitness assessment Older adultsEducation2016, Doctorate, Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo2011, Master's, Clinical Engineering, University of Toronto2009, Bachelor of Applied Science, Biological Engineering, University of GuelphCourses*SYDE 181 - Physics 1 (Statics)Taught in 2015BME 161 - Introduction to Biomedical DesignTaught in 2018, 2019BME 182 - Physics II - DynamicsTaught in 2019SYDE 261 - Design, Systems, and SocietyTaught in 2019SYDE 162 - Human Factors in DesignTaught in 2019BME 362 - Biomedical Engineering Design Workshop 1Taught in 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
