From 1987 to 1990 he worked for Intergraph Corporation as a video graphics custom circuit designer for the unix-based computer aided graphics systems. From 1990 through 1993, he was in the graduate program at the Georgia Institute of Technology with an emphasis in microsystems and specifically in micromachining. In December 1993 he received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. From March 1994 to July 1995, he worked as a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan. While at the University of Michigan, Dr. Frazier focused on the development of integrated hygrometers and integrated transformer technologies. From August 1995 to August 1999, he held a joint faculty position as a professor of electrical engineering and bioengineering at the University of Utah. While there, he published the seminal work on microfluidic systems for cellular analysis and nano-particle separations. In September 1999, he joined the electrical and computer engineering faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology. While at Georgia Tech, he has published work in several areas including advanced packaging technologies, magnetic separation systems, dielectrophoretic separation systems, integrated detection systems for microfluidic separations, integrated analytical systems for neural cultures, and microneedle technologies.
