His group combines observations, theory and numerical models to investigate the physics of the ocean and atmosphere from scales of centimeters to thousand of kilometers. Ferrari has PhDs in Oceanography (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 2000) and Fluid Dynamics (Politecnico di Torino, 1999). Before joining the faculty in 2002 he spent time as a postdoctoral scholar at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). Since 2012 Ferrari has been Director of the Program in Atmospheres, Oceans and Climate. Publications Please see http://ferrari.mit.edu/papers/ for an up to date list.
