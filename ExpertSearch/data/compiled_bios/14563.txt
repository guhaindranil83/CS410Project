She examines how the standards and categories imposed on the world through data, information, and technological systems (or the ways we talk about them) can discriminate by supporting the development of self-respect for some and hindering its development for others. In addition, she's interested in the development and application of research ethics and professional codes of ethics for data scientists, online researchers, and technology developers.
