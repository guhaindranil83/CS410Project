Civil Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL B.S. Civil Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL National Technical University, Athens, GreeceResearch InterestsProf. Daniels research encompasses many areas of mechanics and materials with emphasis on experimental mechanics and composite materials. In the latter, he has worked on all aspects of the area including processing, characterization, and modeling of polymer, ceramic and metal matrix composites; nanocomposites and hybrid nano/microcomposites; fracture and damage mechanics; nondestructive evaluation; and life prediction. He has pioneered test methods for characterization of these materials and has developed a new failure theory, the Northwestern Theory.Significant RecognitionPlenary Speaker, International Conference on Dynamic Response and Failure of Composites (DRAF14), Ischia, Italy.Medal of Excellence in Composite Materials, American Society for CompositesReceive PhD degree, Honoris Causa, from Democritus University of Thrace, GreecePlenary speaker at 10th International Conference on Sandwich Structures, Nantes, FranceBest Paper Award (most highly cited), International Journal of Damage Mechanics, SAGE PublicationsElected Member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts (EASA)Elected Honorary Member of the Society for Experimental MechanicsPlenary speaker at 16th European Conference on Fracture, Alexandroupolis, Greece.Symposium on "Recent Advances in Experimental Mechanics" in honor of Isaac M.

He exposes the students to laboratory demonstrations of composites processing and characterization. He provides the students with an innovative, home-developed computer program for analysis, design, and optimization of composite structures. Course assignments include design and optimization of a composite structure, such as a bicycle, pressure vessel, or torque coupling. In the course he uses a textbook he co-authored on Engineering Mechanics of Composite Materials, now in its second edition, which is very well accepted and widely used around the world.
