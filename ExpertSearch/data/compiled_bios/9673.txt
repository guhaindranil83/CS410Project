Several of the algorithms I developed were incorporated into GHOST (Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology), a surveillance framework created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I have been teaching at the university level since 2010 and enjoying it very much. I am interested in pedagogical advances in teaching computer science and other STEM courses as well as cognitive aspects of learning. I am a big supporter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the worlds largest educational and scientific computing society. As a student, I served first as secretary and then later as chair of GSUs student chapter. I am currently a faculty advisor for the chapter. Publications O. Glebova, S. Knyazev, A. Melnick, A.
