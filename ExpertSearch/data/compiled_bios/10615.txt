Hariri Building 595 Commonwealth Avenue Boston, MA 02215 Download CV Michel Anteby is an Associate Professor of Management and Organizations at Boston Universitys Questrom School of Business and (by courtesy) Sociology at Boston Universitys College of Arts and Sciences. Prior to joining BU, Michel taught in master, doctoral, and executive programs at the Harvard Business School and the Yale School of Management. His research looks at how individuals relate to their work, their occupations, and the organizations they belong to. He examines more specifically the practices people engage in at work that help them sustain their chosen cultures or identities. In doing so, his research contributes to a better understanding of how these cultures and identities come to be and manifest themselves. Studied populations have included airport security officers, clinical anatomists, factory craftsmen, ghostwriters, subway drivers, and university professors. Michels research has appeared in journals such as Administrative Science Quarterly, Academy of Management, Organization Science, Social Science & Medicine, and Social Forces. He also is the author of two monographs: an ethnography of the Harvard Business School titled Manufacturing Morals: The Values of Silence in Business School Education (also available in French and Chinese) and a study of illegal factory production titled Moral Gray Zones: Side Productions, Identity, and Regulation in an Aeronautics Plant. His work was recognized by BUs Slatkin Family Fund award, NYUs Herman E. Krooss award and the David M. Graifman Memorial award. He also is a recipient of the Donald & Valerie Ruth Honerkamp fellowship, a Susilo fellowship, and a Marvin Bower fellowship. Michel earned a joint Ph.D. in management from New York University and in sociology from the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS, Paris). He holds a M.A. in economics from the Sorbonne and a M.P.A. from Harvard. After growing up in France and previously working there as a consultant (focusing on labor issues), he remains affiliated as a Research Fellow with the Centre de Sociologie des Organisations in Paris.
