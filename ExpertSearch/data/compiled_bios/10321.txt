His research interests lie in computer vision, image processing, and pattern recognition with an emphasis on the automated interpretation of satellite imagery. Professor Clausi is a multidisciplinary researcher, publishing refereed journal and conference papers in the diverse fields including remote sensing, computer vision, and algorithm design. His research work has led to successful commercial implementations including the creation and selling of a startup company (CREZ). After successful product deployment and sales, CREZ was purchased by Pointstreak Sports Technologies in 2011. As of result of his teaching and research work, Professor Clausi has received multiple awards including the Research Excellence and Service to the Research Community award from the Canadian Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Society (CIPPRS) in 2010. He has also received numerous Outstanding Performance Awards and Distinguished Performance Awards as well as two teaching awards (Sanford Fleming Teaching Excellence Award. University of Calgary Teaching Excellence Award).Research InterestsComputer VisionRemote Sensing SystemsSports AnalyticsSea Ice MonitoringArtificial IntelligenceMachine LearningDigital Image ProcessingPattern RecognitionSatellite ImagerySignal ProcessingEducation1996, Doctorate, Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo1992, Master's, Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo1990, Bachelor's, Systems Design Engineering, University of WaterlooCourses*SYDE 633 - Remote Sensing SystemsTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018SYDE 121 - Digital ComputationTaught in 2016, 2017SYDE 575 - Image ProcessingTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsAmelard, Robert and Hughson, Richard L and Greaves, Danielle K and Pfisterer, Kaylen J and Leung, Jason and Clausi, David A and Wong, Alexander, Non-contact wide-field hemodynamic imaging reveals the inverted jugular venous pulse waveform, arXiv preprint arXiv:1604.05213, 2016Xu, Linlin and Wong, Alexander and Li, Fan and Clausi, David A, Intrinsic representation of hyperspectral imagery for unsupervised feature extraction, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 54(2), 2016, 1118 - 1130Scharfenberger, Christian and Chung, Audrey G and Wong, Alexander and Clausi, David A, Salient Region Detection Using Self-Guided Statistical Non-Redundancy in Natural Images, IEEE Access, 4, 2016, 48 - 60Wang, Lei and Scott, K Andrea and Clausi, David A, Improved Sea Ice Concentration Estimation Through Fusing Classified SAR Imagery and AMSR-E Data, Canadian Journal of Remote Sensing, 42(1), 2016, 41 - 52Wang, Lei and Scott, K Andrea and Xu, Linlin and Clausi, David A, Sea Ice Concentration Estimation During Melt From Dual-Pol SAR Scenes Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: A Case Study, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 54(8), 2016, 4524 - 4533Amelard, Robert and Clausi, David A and Wong, Alexander, A spectral-spatial fusion model for robust blood pulse waveform extraction in photoplethysmographic imaging, arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.09118, 2016Xu, Linlin and Wong, Alexander and Li, Fan and Clausi, David A, Extraction of Endmembers From Hyperspectral Images Using A Weighted Fuzzy Purified-Means Clustering Model, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 9(2), 2016, 695 - 707Deglint, Jason and Gawish, Ahmed and Zuj, Kathryn and Wong, Alexander and Clausi, David and Hughson, Richard L, Active Contours for Measuring Arterial Wall Diameter of Astronauts from Ultrasound Images, Vision Letters, 1(1), 2015Schwartz, Shimon and Wong, Alexander and Clausi, David A, Optimized sampling distribution based on nonparametric learning for improved compressive sensing performance, Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, 31, 2015, 26 - 40Scharfenberger, Christian and Wong, Alexander and Clausi, David A, Structure-guided statistical textural distinctiveness for salient region detection in natural images, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 24(1), 2015, 457 - 470 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
