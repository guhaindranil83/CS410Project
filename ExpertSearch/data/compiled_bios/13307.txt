He grew up in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, received his undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics from Saint Vincent College in 2001 and his Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2007. He was a postdoctoral researcher at Imperial College London from 2008-2012. Professor Williams works on advancing our knowledge of fundamental particles by both proposing and performing novel experimental measurements at cutting-edge facilities. He is primarily focused on searching for as-yet-unknown particles and forces, possibly components of the dark sector of matter, and on studying largely unexplored emergent properties of QCD. Mike is the founder and leader of the LHCb and GlueX experimental groups at MIT. To enable his scientific pursuits, he also works on advancing the usage of machine learning algorithms and other state-of-the-art data-science tools within the domain of particle physics research.
