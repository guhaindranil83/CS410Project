M.Sc., Physics, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1995. Employment History Professor, School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, 2013-Present Associate Professor, School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, 2010-2013 Assistant Professor, School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, 2005-2010 Staff Member, Theoretical Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2002-2005. Research Interests Our research focuses on the development of predictive atomistic and molecular simulation methodologies to describe materials from first principles, their application to problems of technological importance and quantification of associated uncertainties. Application areas of interest include: electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of nano- and micro-electromechanical systems and electronic and energy conversion devices; thermo-mechanical response of polymer composites and molecular solids; and physics and chemistry of active materials including shape memory and energetic materials. Alejandro H. Strachan Research Interests Selected Publications Publication List News and Announcements An introduction to molecular dynamics. A lecture series on molecular dynamics simulations of materials that includes background physics, applications and a hands-on tutorial to run MD simulations using the "nanoMATERIALS simulation toolkit" nanoMATERIALS simulation toolkit available at the nanoHUB. The tool allows users to perform molecular dynamics simulations of materials using a web-browser. No need to download or install any software nanoMATERIALS online tutorial: Materials strength: does size matter? nanoMATERIALS simulation toolkit tutorial.
