He is also the lead researcher in The Waterloo Public Transportation Initiative (WPTI), which is a UWaterloo research group that provides expertise in urban transportation planning and engineering in order to address the challenges relevant to Canadian and global cities. Professor Casellos primary research interest is in the development and application of quantitative models of transportation (particularly transit and non-motorized modes) system performance. He is also interested in researching the impacts of transportation investments on land use patterns and has published extensively on these topics. Professor Casello specializes in the planning, design and operation of public transportation systems. He is the lead author (with Vukan R. Vuchic) of Transit Planning for the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) 3rd edition of the Transportation Planning Handbook. In addition, he is an acknowledged contributor to two seminal texts in the field: Urban Transit Systems and Technology and Urban Transit Planning, Operations and Economics, both by Professor Vuchic. Professionally, Professor Casello has worked as a consultant, instructor and researcher with many transit agencies in the US, Canada and abroad. These include Singapore (LTA), Washington DC (WMATA), Houston (METRO), Philadelphia (SEPTA), the Regional Municipality of Waterloo (GRT), the City of Kingston, and Mexico City (D.F.). He has also worked in the public sector for the New York State Department of Transportation.Research InterestsPublic TransportationUrban TransportationTransportation ModellingNon-motorized modesPublic transit and transportation planningTransportation EngineeringEnvironmental issues and new material economiesUrbanizationAlternative fuelsTransportation networksRenewable energyConnectivity and Internet of ThingsSmart communitiesBig data/analyticsIoTApplication domainsStakeholdersEducation2003, Doctorate, Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania1999, Master's, Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania1996, Master's, Transportation Engineering, Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute1992, Bachelor's, Civil Engineering Systems, University of PennsylvaniaCourses*CIVE 440 - Transit Planning and OperationsTaught in 2015, 2018CIVE 740 - Topics in Transportation EngineeringTaught in 2015CIVE 484 - Physical Infrastructure PlanningTaught in 2017CIVE 641 - Advances in Public Transportation Planning, Operations & ControlTaught in 2018* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsNour, Akram and Hellinga, Bruce and Casello, Jeffrey, Classification of automobile and transit trips from Smartphone data: Enhancing accuracy using spatial statistics and GIS, Journal of Transport Geography, 51, 2016, 36 - 44Casello, Jeffrey M and Towns, Will and Blanger, Julie and Kassiedass, Sanathan, Public Engagement in Public Transportation Projects: Challenges and Recommendations, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board(2537), 2015, 88 - 95Casello, Jeffrey M and Lewis, Geoffrey McD and Yeung, Kevin and Santiago-Rodrguez, Deborah, A Transit Technology Selection Model, Journal of Public Transportation, 17(4), 2014Casello, Jeffrey and Usyukov, Vladimir, Modeling Cyclists' Route Choice Based on GPS Data, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board(2430), 2014, 155 - 161Dodero, Abel and Casello, Jeffrey and Molinero, Angel and Cotera, Daniel, Evaluating Private Bus Operators' Willingness to Participate in Transit Improvements in Mexico, Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board(2394), 2013, 119 - 127 TOP Share University of Waterloo 200 University Ave W, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1 Phone:(519) 888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
