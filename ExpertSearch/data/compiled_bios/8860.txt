The faculty in the finance area have wide-ranging expertise in all major areas of finance, including: Asset pricing, or how security prices and interest rates are determined in the market. Corporate finance, or how corporations raise capital and make investment decisions. The faculty strive to produce a broad range of finance-related research that addresses topics of interest to academic researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. We communicate that research both through publication in scientific journals, and through the development of relevant and rigorous MBA and Executive Education programs. We also train and mentor future finance scholars through our PhD Program, which is regarded as one of the top finance doctoral programs worldwide.
