Tranchina Professor of Biology, Mathematics, and Neural Science dt2@nyu.edu 212-998-3109 Warren Weaver Hall, Office 918 http://biology.as.nyu.edu/object/DanielTranchina.html Education Ph.D., Neurobiology, Rockefeller University, USA, 1981. B.A., Chemistry, SUNY Binghamton, USA, 1975. Research Interests My main areas of research are computation neuroscience, mathematical biology, and statistics analysis of genome-scale data. Much of this research is united by the theme of stochastic processes. Examples include reproducibility of the single-photon response of retinal rods, population density methods for electrical signaling in large-scale neural networks, stochastic gene expression, and inferences of differential gene expression based on statistical analysis of high throughput sequencing data.
