MultiDiFlux will smooth the raw data for concentration profiles by cubic Hermite interpolation polynomials; it will then calculate the locations of the Matano planes and evaluate the flux profiles of all the components directly from the smoothed concentration profiles. MultiDiFlux also calculates the ternary interdiffusion coefficients over selected concentration ranges in the diffusion zone. The program is based on the analysis method developed by Professor M.A. Dayananda. The downloadable, zipped file provided below contains a copy of the executable MultiDiFlux program, data files for a ternary diffusion couple, and the MultiDiFlux user manual. The use of the program is illustrated in the manual with an example of a ternary diffusion couple identified by a5_a12. This material is based upon the work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0304777.
