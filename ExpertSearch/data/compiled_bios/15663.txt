Weinberg Daniel K. Ludwig Professor for Cancer Research; Member, Whitehead Institute Robert A. Weinberg studies how cancer spreads, what gives cancer stem-cells their unique qualities, and the molecular players involved in the formation of cancer stem cells and metastases. 617-258-5159 Phone WI-301 Office weinberg@wi.mit.edu Email Lab Website Christine Hickey Assistant 617-258-5158 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1969, MIT SB, 1964, Biology, MIT Research Summary We investigate three broad questions related to the origin and spread of cancer. First, how do cancer cells within a primary tumor acquire the ability to invade and metastasize? Second, how are the stem-cell state and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition interrelated? Third, how are the regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition able to activate this profound change in cell phenotype?
