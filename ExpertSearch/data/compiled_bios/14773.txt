She has extensively studied the decisions of emergency department nurses' who triage women for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and the treatment seeking decisions of women with acute MI. As part of this research, she developed and tested the Nurses' Cardiac Triage Instrument. Her research foci have recently expanded to include the study of decision regret among critical care nurses, the examination of cognitive dysfunction among older adults hospitalized for acute heart failure, high stakes decision making for seriously ill hospitalized children, and decision support for stroke surrogate decision makers. Her team is pilot testing an innovative education and cognitive training intervention to improve self-care management decisions for older adults with heart failure. Her research has been published in American Journal of Cardiology, American Journal of Critical Care, Circulation, Journal of Cardiac Failure, Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing, Journal of Emergency Nursing, and Nursing Research.Current Research Grants and Programs Development of a tailored life-sustaining decision support intervention for stroke surrogate decision makers (1-R21-NR-016332-01-A1), 2017- 2019.

At the undergraduate level, she has used her expertise to teach clinical decision-making and adult health nursing. At the graduate level, she has taught nursing theory, research, and advanced practice didactic and clinical courses to the acute care graduate nursing students. In addition, she has mentored undergraduate honors students and graduate students in the completion of their research and scholarly projects (e.g., masters projects, doctoral preliminary examinations, dissertations, etc.). Dr. Arslanian-Engoren often includes students as members of her research team, providing mentorship experiences and experiential knowledge of critical aspects of scientific inquiry.
