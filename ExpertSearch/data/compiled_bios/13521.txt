Aifantis Associate Professor and MAE Faculty Fellow (352) 392-6227work kaifantis@ufl.eduINTERNET Education BS, Michigan Technological Univ, 2002,MPhil, Univ of Cambridge (Pembroke College), 2004,PhD, Univ of Groningen, 2005 Research Interests Katerina E. Aifantis focuses on using solid mechanics for understanding materials behavior at the nanoscale. Through funding from the Basic Energy Sciences Office of the Department of Energy she tries to understand the effect that grain boundary structure and chemistry have on the strength of sub-micron scale materials.
