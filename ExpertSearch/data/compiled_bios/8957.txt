Participants discussed research across fields, learned from diverse academic leaders, and networked with colleagues across the country. The conferences objectives were to help rising scholars gain research insights, valuable exposure, and faculty mentorship that will benefit them for years to come. Stanford GSB strongly encouraged participation from underrepresented groups such as Black PhD students and postdocs, as well as from others whose backgrounds and experience would bring additional dimensions to the educational experience. We strongly believe in the value of diversity (broadly defined) in the pursuit of our educational mission. Faculty Speakers Student/Postdoc Presentations We were pleased to welcome 56 PhD students/postdocs from 30 institutions to present research across a variety of fields.
