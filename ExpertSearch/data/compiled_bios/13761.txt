HowlandAssistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Research Interests:Fluid mechanics, renewable energy systems, wind energy, optimal control, environmental flows, weather and climate modeling, uncertainty quantification, turbulence ConnectMIT Room 1-290 77 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge, MA, 02139 Telephone:617.253.7101 Email:mhowland@mit.edu Website: howlandlab.com Education Ph.D., Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University | 2020 M.S., Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University | 2018 B.S., Mechanical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University | 2016 Research InterestsOur group studies the flow physics of Earths atmosphere and the modeling, optimization, and control of renewable energy generation systems. This work is focused at the intersection of fluid mechanics, weather and climate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and optimization and control with an emphasis on renewable energy systems. We use synergistic approaches including simulations, laboratory and field experiments, and modeling to understand the operation of renewable energy systems, with the goal of improving the efficiency, predictability, and reliability of low-carbon energy generation. We are pursuing two coupled research themes: Modeling complex environment-energy system interactions through the use of simulations and experiments Leveraging the developed models in full-scale field experiments or case studies to improve the operation and integration of low-carbon generation Teaching Interests Seminar on the development of low-carbon energy resources Atmospheric boundary layer flow and wind energy Fluid mechanics and turbulence Selected Publications Howland, M.
