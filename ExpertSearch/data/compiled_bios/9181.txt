He spent most of his early research career in the Los Alamos Theory Division, where he was a J. Robert Oppenheimer Fellow and later a staff member. He moved to the University of Washington in 1984 as Professor and, for 15 years, Director of the Department of Energys Institute for Nuclear Theory. In 2009 he joined UC Berkeley as Professor of Physics and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory as Senior Faculty Scientist. His research interests include neutrino physics, nuclear astrophysics, tests of fundamental symmetries, and many-body theory. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Washington State Academy of Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Physical Society. He received the Hans Bethe Prize from the APS in 2004. He has held visiting Fellowships from the Guggenheim, Miller, and Alexander von Humboldt Foundations and the Phi Beta Kappa Society.
