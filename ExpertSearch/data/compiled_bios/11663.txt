He uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the mechanics of brain injury and brain development. He also studies the nonlinear dynamic phenomena that underlie the oscillatory movements of cells and microorganisms. Biography Professor Bayly has been a member of the faculty at Washington University since 1993. In 1996, he was the recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER Award. In 2004, he was awarded Engineering Professor of the Year and he has twice received the School of Engineering & Applied Science "Big Fish" Award for graduate student mentoring. From 1988 to 1990, Professor Bayly worked as an engineer for Pitney Bowes in Stamford, CT and for the Shriners Hospital in Springfield, MA.
