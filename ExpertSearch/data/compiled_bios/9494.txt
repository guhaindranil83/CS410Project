These imaging techniques are used to investigate cellular metabolism, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, drug delivery, and development in living organisms. She is combining bioorthogonal labeling SRS and MPM for directly visualizing in situ complex molecular events in brain, tumor, and metabolic diseases at sub-cellular scale. These approaches representpowerful tools for disease detection, diagnosis and treatment, as well as for mechanistic understanding of scientific fundamentals. Capsule Bio:Dr. Shi is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering. She received her Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the City College of New York (CCNY). She was a postdoc at the Institute for Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Lasers at CCNY. She then moved to the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University for her second postdoctoral training in biophotonics, prior to her joining UC San Diego. Dr. Shi major scientific contributions include the discovery of the Golden Optical Window for deep brain imaging, and the development of a breakthrough platform that combines deuterium probing with stimulated Raman scattering microscopy for optical imaging of metabolic dynamics in living organism in situ. Dr. Shi won the Blavatnik Regional Awards for Young Scientists in 2018. Herprimary research interests focus on developing and applying novel optical techniques for studying neuroscience, cancer, and metabolism. Dr. Shi has been mentoring graduate and undergraduate studentsto help them achieve excellence in academic work and become successful engineers and scientists. She plans to continue making additional contributions by enhancing more participation of underrepresented groups from the UC San Diego communities. She will teach core undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Bioengineering.
