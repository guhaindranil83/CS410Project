He received his Ph.D. in engineering science from Harvard University and his B.S. in applied physics from Cornell. He did postdoctoral research at Harvard University, leading to the development of small robots that arehighly agile, multifunctional, and robust.His work has appeared in top journals includingScience Robotics, Nature, andNature Communications, among others. He has been aForbes 30 Under 30fellow. He investigatesmillimeter-scaled biomechanics, distilling the underlying physical principles, and then applies these findings to enable novel functions in microrobots. He is also interested in developing novel soft actuators to enable agile and robust locomotion in microrobots.
