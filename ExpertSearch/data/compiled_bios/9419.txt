Contact information Office: PHY 250 Phone: 519 888-4567 ext. 35580 Email:idziak@uwaterloo.ca Expertise Complex fluids Confinement Synchrotron x-ray diffraction Research Confinement of complex fluid systems between two surfaces or in narrow pores is known to strongly alter the collective structure of the trapped molecules in fluids composed of molecular aggregates such as polymers, vesicles, biomembranes, or colloidal particles suspended in the liquid. The understanding of these new fluid properties is both of intrinsic and practical interest ranging from thin film lubrication to catalysis and separations. The X-Ray Surface Forces Apparatus (XSFA) is capable of imaging. Research projects include using the XSFA to study the effects of lubrication on wear; the investigation of the structure of flowing complex fluids; and the study of novel complex fluid and membrane systems. This work is conducted using both in-house x-ray diffraction facilities as well as high resolution synchrotron diffraction techniques.
