My primary research interests lie in the area of formal semantics and the philosophy of language. I also have interests in program analysis, particularly in human comprehension of computer programs, and process modelling. Much of my work in these last two areas exploits ideas and techniques from language analysis. I also have an interest in the uses and abuses of technology in the context of human and humanitarian rights. Please see personal website for more details of my research, and links to papers.
