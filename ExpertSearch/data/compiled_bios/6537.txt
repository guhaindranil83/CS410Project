Engineering Sciences (Aerospace Engineering), University of California San Diego B.Sc. Mathematical Physics, Simon Fraser University Previous appointments Lecturer, San Diego State University, 2019-2020 Instructional Assistant Professor, University of Mississippi, 2014-2019 Research Statement Recent years have seen an increase in technology used in undergraduate courses, from A/V equipment to learning management systems, online homework platforms, and ebooks. The newest such technology is adaptive software which has the potential to customize learning paths for individual students. My research is focused on the impact of such systems on student learning outcomes in such as performance (GPA, failure rates, etc.) and retention (both at the individual course and program levels) in undergraduate engineering courses. The goal of this is to optimize the amount and type of technology used in these courses to provide the best possible chance of success for each student in the program.
