He obtained PhD from Princeton University, and BE from Tsinghua University, both in electrical engineering. His research interests lie in the intersection of information theory, high dimensional probability, and statistics. His previous research topics include non-convex optimizations for sparse signal reconstructions, information-theoretic secrecy, polar codes, and applications of functional analysis and high dimensional probability ideas in information-theoretic converses.
