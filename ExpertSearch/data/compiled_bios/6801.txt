Adhesion,friction, and wetting mechanisms are critical surface phenomena that must be addressed andunderstood to enable innovations in polymer surfaces and coatings technologies. Utilizing custom-built mechanical testing devices in situ with optical microscopy, she is developing new insights intopolymer interfacial properties and mechanics.
