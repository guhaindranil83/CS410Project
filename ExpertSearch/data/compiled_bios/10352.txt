His research interests lie in the electrophysiological characterization of neuromuscular disorders, quantitative EMG, EMG signal decomposition, , Decomposition-based Quantitative Electromyography (DQEMG) and EMG signal simulation. Currently, the major objectives of Professor Stashuks ongoing research are to develop and evaluate clinical methods that can assist with the characterization of neuromuscular disorders based on the interpretation of DQEMG results, and to introduce new quantitative statistics that effectively reflect neuromuscular structure and physiology. In addition to his research work, Professor Stashuk has several publications that cover the topics of electromyography and electromyographic signals.Research InterestsErgonomicsHuman Factors & BiomedicalModeling & SimulationSignal & Image ProcessingDecisions Under UncertaintyEMG signal simulationMachine Intelligence and Knowledge Based SystemsAdaptive and Nonlinear SystemsPattern AnalysisQuantitative Clinical DiagnosisBiosignal detection and analysis Electromyographic (EMG) signal detection and analysisClinical quantitative EMGElectrophysiological Characterization of Neuromuscular DisordersClinical Decision SupportMotor Unit Number EstimationDecomposition-based Quantitative Electromyography Education1985, Doctorate, PhD, McMaster University1982, Master's, MEng, McMaster University1978, Bachelor's, BEng, University of WaterlooCourses*SYDE 202 - SeminarTaught in 2016SYDE 675 - Pattern RecognitionTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018SYDE 384 - Biological and Human SystemsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018BME 401 - SeminarTaught in 2019BME 461 - Biomedical Engineering Design Workshop 2Taught in 2019SYDE 292 - Circuits, Instrumentation, and MeasurementsTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsPower, Geoffrey A and Allen, Matti Douglas and Gilmore, Kevin J and Stashuk, Daniel W and Doherty, Timothy J and Hepple, Russell T and Taivassalo, Tanja and Rice, Charles L, MOTOR UNIT NUMBER AND TRANSMISSION STABILITY IN OCTOGENARIAN WORLD CLASS ATHLETES: CAN AGE-RELATED DEFICITS BE OUTRUN?, Journal of Applied Physiology, 2016Piasecki, M and Ireland, A and Stashuk, D and Hamilton-Wright, A and Jones, D and McPhee, J, Age associated motor unit loss is not attenuated by high levels of lifelong exercise, Proceedings of The Physiological Society, 2016Ireland, A and Piasecki, M and Coulson, J and Hamilton-Wright, A and Stashuk, D and Jones, D and McPhee, J, Lifelong exercise is associated with greater age-related motor unit remodelling, Proceedings of The Physiological Society, 2016Raheja, Divisha and Simmons, Zachary and Stashuk, Daniel, Qualitative Review of Quantitative EMG Results Can Improve Needle EDX Studies (P6. 261), Neurology, 86(16 Sup), 2016Gilmore, Kevin J and Kimpinski, Kurt and Stashuk, Daniel and Doherty, Tim J and Rice, Charles L, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy: Muscle Atrophy Associated with Denervation and Neuromuscular Transmission Instability, The FASEB Journal, 30(1 Supp), 2016, 991 - 7 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
