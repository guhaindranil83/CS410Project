His goal is to enable human-level perception and world understanding on mobile robotics platforms (micro aerial vehicles, self-driving vehicles, ground robots) operating in the real world. Towards this goal, his work involves a combination of rigorous theory and practical implementations. In particular, his research interests include nonlinear estimation and probabilistic inference, numerical and distributed optimization, and computer vision applied to sensing, perception, and decision-making in single and multi-robot systems. Human-level perception will increasereliability in safety-critical applications of robotics and autonomous vehicles (including self-driving cars and robotics for disaster response), and increase efficiency and effectiveness in service robotics and consumer applications (manufacturing, healthcare, domestic robotics, augmented reality).
