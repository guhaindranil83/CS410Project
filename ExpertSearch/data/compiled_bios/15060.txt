He isinterested in cybersecurity and data privacy with a recent focus on the intersections between security, privacy, and machine learning. On one hand, he leverages machine learning techniques to study security and privacy. On the other hand, he builds secure and privacy-preserving machine learning. He is also interested in mobile and IoT security, privacy, and forensics. He received an NSF CAREER Award in 2018 as well as multiple best paper awards or nominations. Hereceived a B.E. from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2010 (with the highest honor) and a Ph.D in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley in 2015. During 2015-2019, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Iowa State University.
