I finished my Ph.D in mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University in 2015. I received my Bachelors degree in mathematics from Universidad de Los Andes in Bogot, Colombia, in 2010. Broadly speaking, my main academic interests lie in the fields of applied analysis, computational probability and statistics, and machine learning; my academic background is a mixture of mathematical analysis and statistics. One of my main lines of research lies at the intersection of calculus of variations, optimal transport, and PDEs, and studies the connections between graph-based techniques for learning and continuum problems modelled by PDEs and calculus of variations. In my work I have developed mathematical tools to study large sample asymptotics for such graph based problems and have studied some of the computational implications of this analysis.
