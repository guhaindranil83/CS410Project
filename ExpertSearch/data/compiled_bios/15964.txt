Quackenbush Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering Phillips Hall, Room 425 607/255-0605 Associate Dean on Research Graduate Studies and Entrepreneurship Materials Science and Engineering grace.xing@cornell.eduBack to DirectoryBiographyHuili (Grace) Xing is theWilliam L. Quackenbush Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineeringat Cornell University where she holds a joint appointment in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.Xing was appointed to a two-year term as Associate Dean for Research, Entrepreneurship, and Graduate Studies for the College of Engineering in January 2020.Xing received a Bachelor Degree in Physics from Peking University. After that, she pursued a Master Degree in Material Science and Engineering at Lehigh University. Wanting to work with devices that use wonderful material properties, she went to the University of California at Santa Barbara for her Ph.D. and eventually earned a degree in Electrical Engineering. From 2004 to 2014 she was a faculty member at the University of Notre Dame. Xing joined Cornell in 2015.Research InterestsXing's research work can be loosely categorized into 4 areas, supported by DoD, NSF, SRC,DoE, etc.III-VNitride materials and devices. Example projects includeAlN/GaN ultrascaled high electron/hole mobility transistors for high-speed high-power applications, fundamental science of polarization doping in polar semiconductors, applications of polar semiconductors in electronics and in photonics including UVoptoelectronics, non-linear optical materials, piezoelectric properties and RF filters, GaN power diodes andtransistors, resonant tunneling diodes, negative differential resistance and plasma based THzsources, wafer fused enabled hybridstructures, and BN.Oxide materials and devices. Example projects include epitaxy, physics and applications of Ga2O3, Al2O3 and related materials, high-performing electronics based on complex oxide semiconductors.Low-dimensional materials and quantum materials. Ongoing projects include epitaxy and properties of hBN, epitaxial superconductors integrated on the III-V nitrides platform and related science and technologies. Past projects include nanowires and devices (InGaN and II-VIs),2D crystal materials and devices including van der Waals epitaxy, carrierelectrostatics and transport, optoelectronic responses, p-n junctions andheterostructures, field modulation and tunneling, metamaterials and THzapplications, graphene physics and devices.Logic and memory materials and devices. Ongoing projects include conceptualizing and developing non-volatile memories with high endurance for processing-in-memory (PIM) such as spin-orbit-torque field-effect transistor (SOTFET) and ion-based memories. Past projects include steep slope transistors for high-efficiency logic and RF electronics, especiallytunnel FETs. We pioneered design, fabrication and characterization of III-VTFETs, later 2D-crystal based steep slope transistors: the Thin-TFETs.Advanced MaterialsEnergy SystemsAdvanced Materials ProcessingMaterials Synthesis and ProcessingNanotechnologyNonlinear DynamicsSemiconductor Physics and DevicesSensors and ActuatorsSolid State, Electronics, Optoelectronics and MEMsPower ElectronicsSelected PublicationsReet Chaudhuri, Samuel James Bader,Zhen Chen, David A.
