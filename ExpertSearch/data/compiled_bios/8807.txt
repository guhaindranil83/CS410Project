Proposal Preparation Assist faculty and departmental budget staff with the development of proposal budgets, justifications, sponsor forms, internal routing documentation, etc. for sponsored grants/contracts. College review for all proposal documentation prior to submission to ensure that applicable costing policies are followed and are compliant with university, federal and sponsor guidelines. Facilitate the internal routing process by ensuring that the appropriate documentation has been included for college authorization and release of the proposal to the Office of Sponsored Projects Administration for institutional signature. Identify the need for other required approvals and facilitate interaction with the appropriate offices (e.g. human subjects, animal subjects, biohazards, etc.). Assist faculty with electronic proposal submission to various sponsors. Guide faculty in the preparation of forms to establish subcontracts and consulting agreements. Account & Grant Management Complete periodic reviews of grant-related accounts and expenditures for compliance with sponsor and university guidelines. Serve the college as a liaison with other University units including: Office of Sponsored Projects Administration, Research Financial Services, Accounts Payable, and Purchasing and work with departmental business staff to facilitate the resolution of accounting problems on grant accounts. Coordinate with departmental business staff to ensure that appropriate action is taken for new accounts to document effort (charging and cost-sharing) in FES; coordinate with appropriate person new and existing positions in grant budget; coordinate system to document cost-sharing other than faculty salary. Maintain college proposal files, award documentation, correspondence, etc. Utilize various reporting tools to provide grant management reports for departmental business staff, investigators, department chairs and deans that can be used for strategic planning and monitoring university account activities. Useful Information for Preparing Proposals Find useful information such as the F&A rate, fringe benefits rates, official name and address of the organizationand more here.

We would like to know of your intentions to submit as early as possible and at least 30 days prior to the sponsors deadline is preferred. What if I decide to submit a proposal but the deadline is less than 30 days away? We understand tight turn-around times and will work with you to meet the external deadlines. The more lead time we have, however, the more we can help. How do I develop an accurate budget for my proposal? We encourage investigators to work with your CGO to develop a detailed budget for the project. The CGO will ensure the adequacy of requested resources and compliance with sponsor and university regulations. Is institutional approval required before I submit my proposal? UK requires program directors/principal investigators (PD/PI) to provide a project title and drafts of the project budget, budget justification, and abstract for review and approval prior to proposal submission. These documents are attached to the electronic Internal Approval Form (eIAF). Who has to approve the eIAF? eIAFs must be approved by the PD/PI, co-investigators, and other faculty who are named as Senior Key Personnel, regardless of their role on the project. Additionally, the eIAF must be approved (certified) by the Chairs, College Grant Officers, and ADRs of each represented faculty member. When does the eIAF have to be completed? The Office of Sponsored Projects Administration (OSPA) requires the eIAF to be fully executedat least three (3) business days prior to the sponsors published deadline. When should I initiate my eIAF? To increase the likelihood of complete routing at least three business days before the sponsors deadline, we recommend initiating the eIAF tenbusiness days before the published due date. Do I have to complete an eIAF for an internal grant opportunity? No. However, your CGOs would still like to work with you on internal grant submissions. We can ensure you have requested adequate resources andobtained the necessary departmental approvals, and we can assist with the preparation and submission of your proposal. Can I submit a grant proposal directly to the sponsor without institutional approval? No. Most grants are made to the institution and not to individual investigators. As such, the institution has a responsibility to review and approve any commitment of resources (effort, lab space, cost-sharing, etc.), ensure alignment with the institutions missions and valuesand capture all of the sponsor-required investigator certifications. What will happen if I submit a proposal outside of the established process and it is awarded? We hope this does nothappen. If it does, we may decline the award if it is not in the best interest of the institution. If the award is accepted, the institution may negotiate significant changes to the budget and/or the terms of the project. This can cause a significant delay in account set-up. Can I submit a pre-application or letter of intent to a sponsor without notifying anyone? We strongly encourage investigators to notify their CGO when they intend to submit a pre-application or letter of intent. We report on all proposal activity and would like to reflect your efforts on the reports. Furthermore, OSPA requires an eIAF for pre-applications that require a budget. Your CGO can help you navigate internal and external requirements for these pre-submissions. Is cost sharing allowed on grant proposals? Voluntary cost sharing is typically prohibited, but sometimes it is necessary for us to assume some of the costs of the project. Before you may add cost share to a proposal budget, it must be approved in advance by the appropriate Chair and the Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies prior to proposal submission to ensure compliance with University cost-share policies. When necessary, it may have to be approved by the Office of Sponsored Projects Administration. If my proposal is declined funding, should I tell anyone? Yes. The Office of Research tracks proposal (pre-application, letter of intent, etc.) submissions throughout their life cycle, and the final funding decision is critical to successful tracking. We provide funding decisions to OSPA so the institutional record is complete as well. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we can work with you to determine a resubmission strategy when appropriate.
