Our work runs the gamut,from computational analyses to experimentalin vitro andin vivosystems, andclinical studiesand field work. Threethematic areas characterize our facultys research: Biomedical Engineering At the intersection of chemical engineering and biology, on-goingresearch includes biomaterials for neural tissue engineering, systems proteomic analyses of microbial function, novel biomaterials and platforms for hemostasis and drug delivery, and engineeredplatforms and systems biology applied to investigate and treatimmune dysfunction in cancer and infectious disease. Faculty: Lavik, Leach, Pan Biochemical Engineering Research in this area strives to engineer host cells to efficiently produce greater amounts of recombinant protein andcell-free systems to produce therapeutics automatically. Systems biology studies strive to understand gene regulatory networks using proteomic analysis and mathematical modelling. In the traditional area of bioprocess engineering, research includes studiesto improvechromatographic separations of recombinant protein and sensordevelopment for a myriad of applications. Faculty: Frey, Marten,Moreira,Rao Environmental Engineering Environmental engineers in the department are actively researching the fate and impact of pharmaceuticals in wastewater, analysis and remediation of toxic pollutants in soils and other environments, the processes governingatmospheric chemistry and aerosol pollution, and advanced real-time modeling and monitoring ofgroundwater-surface water conditions.
