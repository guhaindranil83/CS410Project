Dr. Davis has co-authored over 75 refereed journal, conference, and workshop publications, and his papers have been referenced over 2500 times by researchers from around the world [scholar.google.com]. He also co-authored and co-edited a book entitled Interconnect Technology and Design for Gigascale Integration, which has recently been translated into Chinese and republished in 2010. His current research interests are exploring the low-frequency electrical properties of nanocomposite materials, and in 2012-2013 he was awarded the Georgia Tech Fund for Innovation in Research and Education (GT-FIRE) for this work. The application of this technology is to develop solid-state capacitors that have extremely high-energy density for electrical energy storage. He also explores novel ways to completely replace conventional electrochemical batteries with capacitive energy storage in a variety of everyday products. Research interests: Low-Frequency Electrical Properties of Nanocomposite Materials Surface Polarization Mechanisms in Large Bandgap Insulators Energy Storage Limits of Dielectric Nanolaminate Structures Microstructual Simulation of Nanocomposites Using FD and FEM Supercapacitor Energy Storage Applications in Transportation, Robotics, and Computing Distinctions: 2001 NSF CAREER Award 2002-2003 Outstanding Junior Faculty Award in ECE 2004-2005 Class of 1940 W.
