Professor Fowlers research focuses on electrochemical power sources in vehicles, specifically degradation analysis and control of batteries in hybrid and plug-in hybrid power trains. His interest takes him into the modelling of fuel cells and requires simulating the performance and reliability of fuel cells and batteries. Professor Fowlers research group is interested in performance evaluation, diagnostics, and forensics associated with fuel cell stacks, single cells and batteries. His study of fuel cell failure mode and reliability also encompasses the extensive development of polymers due to their function as the fuel cells electrolyte, gas diffusion layer and blending of polymers for conductive bipolar plates. One of the key questions to be addressed in the 'hydrogen economy' is the clean production and distribution of hydrogen. Through a series of publications and presentations, his work has furthered the concept of 'clean energy hubs' as distributed energy generation systems including wind and solar, and large scale systems with CO2 free nuclear energy as a key components of the hubs. Unique to this work is the consideration the integration of natural gas and electrical distribution systems through the Power to Gas concept of energy storage and distribution. This work has principally included hydrogen as an energy vector, but also considered the impact of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles within such clean energy hubs. His expertise in fuel cell technology has landed him the position of co-faculty supervisor of competitive vehicle team design projects; ChallengeX and EcoCar where he has supervised the development of two fuel cell vehicles, and two plug-in hybrid vehicle. Professor Fowler assists these teams with their design, construction, implementation and testing of hybrid vehicles. He also supervises other award winning student teams in the design of Green Energy Systems.Research InterestsGreen Reaction EngineeringPolymer ScienceInterfacial PhenomenaColloids & Porous MediaModelling of Hydrogen Energy Hubs and Power to Gas Energy StorageReliability Assessment of Electrochemical Storage SystemsDevelopment of Battery and Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Train Vehicles and Test BenchesEducation2003, Doctorate, Chemical and Materials Engineering (Fuel Cell Reliability), Royal Military College of Canada1995, Certificate in Environmental Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment, Lakehead University1988, Master's, Engineering Chemistry (Polymer Processing), Queen's University, Kingston1986, Bachelor's, Fuels and Materials Engineering, Royal Military College of CanadaCourses*CHE 201 - SeminarTaught in 2015CHE 298 - Directed Research ProjectTaught in 2015CHE 301 - SeminarTaught in 2015CHE 302 - SeminarTaught in 2015CHE 398 - Directed Research ProjectTaught in 2015CHE 399 - Directed Research ProjectTaught in 2015CHE 402 - SeminarTaught in 2015CHE 100 - Chemical Engineering Concepts 1Taught in 2015CHE 499 - Elective Research ProjectTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018ME 760 - Special Topics in Thermal EngineeringTaught in 2016CHE 755 - Res Topics in Electrochemical Engineering, Interfacial Eng & Material ScienceTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019CHE 571 - Industrial EcologyTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017ME 599 - Special Topics in Mechanical EngineeringTaught in 2017, 2018CHE 483 - Group Design ProjectTaught in 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 482 - Chemical Engineering Design WorkshopTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMalik, M and Dincer, I and Rosen, Marc A and Mathew, M and Fowler, M, Thermal and electrical performance evaluations of series connected Li-ion batteries in a pack with liquid cooling, Applied Thermal Engineering, 129, 2018, 472 - 481Sherman, Steven B and Cano, Zachary P and Fowler, Michael and Chen, Zhongwei, Range-extending Zinc-air battery for electric vehicle, , 2018Haghi, Ehsan and Raahemifar, Kaamran and Fowler, Michael, Investigating the effect of renewable energy incentives and hydrogen storage on advantages of stakeholders in a microgrid, Energy Policy, 113, 2018, 206 - 222Walker, Sean B and Sun, Duo and Kidon, Dominika and Siddiqui, Ashar and Kuner, Amrit and Fowler, Michael and Simakov, David SA, Upgrading biogas produced at dairy farms into renewable natural gas by methanation, International Journal of Energy Research, 2018Panchal, Satyam and Dincer, Ibrahim and Agelin-Chaab, Martin and Fraser, Roydon and Fowler, Michael, Design and simulation of a lithium-ion battery at large C-rates and Varying boundary conditions through heat flux distributions, Measurement, 116, 2018, 382 - 390In the NewsResearch Engineering outreach Entrepreneurship Teaching and Learning International News Events Faculty openings INFORMATION FOR Future undergraduate students Current undergraduate students Future graduate students Current graduate students Alumni and TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 6(E6) Phone:519-888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Chemical Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
