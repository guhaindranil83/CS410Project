McVeigh Professor, BioengineeringFaculty, Bioengineering Cardiovascular Imaging, MRI CT. Image guided therapy. Novel MRI and CT methods. McVeigh aims to develop imaging techniques that give patients and their doctors exactly the information they need to put them on a path to avoid heart attacks, which remain the leading cause of death in the United States despite years of progress in research and treatments. McVeigh and his team plan to develop ultra-low dose CT angiography techniques that will identify those people at substantially higher risk for heart disease. This will allow physicians to guide the right patients into aggressive therapy, such as stents and bypass surgery and identify those who need to begin a course of medical therapy, such as statins, and those who need to change their lifestyleand stick to those changes. The ultimate goal is to create a completely new imaging paradigm for cardiac care. Capsule Bio: Before joining the University of California, San Diego, McVeigh was chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, where he founded the Medical Imaging Laboratory. In 1999, McVeigh joined forces with the Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics at the National Institutes of Health to develop a research program in cardiovascular interventional MRI. McVeigh had been on the Johns Hopkins faculty since 1988, immediately after earning his Ph.D. in medical biophysics at the University of Toronto, where he also earned a bachelors in physics in 1984.
