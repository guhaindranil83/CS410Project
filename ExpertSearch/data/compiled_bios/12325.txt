Kirschstein F32 Postdoctoral Fellowship, 2011-2014 Organometallics Gordon Research Seminar Co-Chair, 2011 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, 2006-2009 Research Interests The increase in worldwide demand for energy, coupled with the proposed role of CO2 on global warming and the eventual depletion of fossil fuels, necessitates the development of new technologies for the efficient conversion of energy. My research program is focused on developing a fundamental understanding of transition-metal mediated small molecule activation, as it pertains to energy conversion and green synthetic applications. Using motifs found in Nature, we will design and develop transition metal complexes that will allow us to test ideas on how to selectively achieve complex multi-e/multi-H+ chemical transformations at low over-potentials. Topics of current interest include (i) activation of O2 for fuel cell and synthetic applications, and (ii) electrocatalytic CO2 fixation and CO2 reduction to methanol. Detailed reactivity and mechanistic studies will be combined with a wealth of data from spectroscopic and structural techniques to provide insights to these transformations, which will allow for the rational design of functional catalysts. Members of my group will become proficient in a variety of techniques, for example: (i) organic/inorganic synthesis (including glove-box, Schlenk, and high-vacuum techniques), (ii) multi-nuclear and VT-NMR, IR, and UV-vis spectroscopy, (iii) electrochemistry, (iv) single crystal X-ray diffraction, and (v) analysis of kinetic data. Other techniques such as EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and DFT calculations may also be utilized. Selected Publications Saouma, C. T.; Lu, C. C.; Day, M. W.; Peters, J. C.
