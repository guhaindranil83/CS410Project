Activities & Awards NIH NSRA Postdoctoral Fellow, 2008 Research Interests A major contemporary challenge is development of efficient and sustainable systems for energy utilization. Biology is instructive in this endeavor, providing biochemical solutions to a variety of physiological needs in energy conversion and storage. Metalloproteins play central roles in these solutions and thus provide impetus for understanding the mechanistic bioinorganic chemistry of metalloproteins for application to practical bioinspired catalysis. My laboratory is using what we, and others, learn about how metalloproteins function as inspiration for development of unique energy conversion and storage systems. Being at the nexus of bioinorganic and bioinspired chemistry requires us to employ a multi-disciplinary approach spanning chemical synthesis, molecular biology, physical methods, and theory. This approach fosters a rich training environment for students. We are presently focused on three distinct problems in energy utilization. First, inspired by photosynthesis, we are developing catalysis that evolve oxygen from water and overcome the traditional synthetic challenges of large overpotentials and poor product release. The catalyst design is accomplished by computationally guided exploration of novel O-O bond forming strategies towards the ultimate goal of practical artificial photosynthesis on electrode surfaces. Second, we are investigating the arguably most important biological energy conversion process, the four-electron reduction of dioxygen to water, which drives the pumping of protons across the mitochondrial membrane during respiration. To uncover the structure-function correlations that couple these events, we are developing new time-resolved spectroscopic probes and methods for in vitro and in vivo use. Finally, we are elucidating the detailed molecular mechanism of ethylene signaling in the ubiquitious copper containing ethylene receptor. The ethylene signaling pathway impacts all phases of plant growth and development and thus has considerable global impact on biofuel and foodstuff production. More broadly, our fundamental interest in metalloprotein mechanism overlaps problems with significant health, environmental, and technology implications. Metalloproteins are an intrinsically interesting way to study inorganic chemistry as some metalloprotein catalyzed reactions exist for which there is no benchtop equivalent.
