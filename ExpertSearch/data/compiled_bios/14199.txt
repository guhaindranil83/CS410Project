Currently, he is most concerned with establishing a comprehensive framework for using hydrogeophysical-derived soil moisture information to further our understanding and quantitative characterization of shallow vadose zone processes, such as evapotranspiration, freeze-thaw cycles, groundwater recharge and nutrient transport, beyond the knowledge obtained through the use of conventional moisture monitoring techniques. This work is focused on the use of non-invasive surface geoelectrical methods (electrical resistivity tomography, electromagnetic ground conductivity meter and ground penetrating radar). In conjunction with this research, he is using these geophysical methods to study freshwater ice and seasonal snowpacks.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
