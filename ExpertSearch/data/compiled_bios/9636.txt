Douglas Haessig Assistant Professor, Mathematics Ph.D., University of California, Irvine, 2005 B.S., University of California, Santa Barbara, 1998 CV | Seminars Research Summary A large part of my research consists of studying families of exponential sums over finite fields. My approach mostly uses techniuqes of p-adic analysis, pioneered by Bernard Dwork in the 1960s. Selected Publications Haessig. p-adic unit roots of L-functions over finite fields Haessig.
