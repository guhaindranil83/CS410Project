Her recent research has dealt with evaluating the impacts of combined sewer overflows on river water quality, as well as the role that particulate matter plays in the fate and transport of microbial pollution. She is additionally interested in biofilms found both in engineered and natural systems and the utilization of tools such as confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and microelectrodes to investigate these ubiquitous coatings.
