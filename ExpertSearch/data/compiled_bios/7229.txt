His work led to the first experimental proof-of-concept demonstration of the negative capacitancea novel physical phenomenon that can lead to ultra-low power computing and memory platforms by overcoming the fundamental "Boltzmann Limit" of 60 mV/decade subthreshold swing in field-effect transistors. Asif Khan received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley in 2015 and his B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2007. He joined the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology as a tenure-track assistant professor in the Spring of 2017.
