He served as the Chair of the OSUNuclear Engineering Program at between 2007 - 2016. He isa Fellow of the American Nuclear Society anda recipient of the OSUCollege of Engineering Lumley Interdisciplinary Research Award in 2015 and 2020. Tunc Aldemirhas beena member of theeditorial board of the journalReliability Engineering and System Safety since 2004 and hasserved as an International Atomic Energy Agency expert to various countries on research reactor safety. Expertise Tunc Aldemir's broad area of specialization is nuclear reactor safety, with emphasis on reliability and probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). His research in PRA focuses on systems which may be difficult to model using conventional techniques, such as those with significant hardware/software/human/process interactions, passive components and/or relying on natural phenomena for safety. He haspublished more than 250 refereed articles on various deterministic and probabilisticaspects of nuclear reactor safety. His research efforts have been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Idaho National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
