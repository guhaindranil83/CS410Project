Biography Biography I was born and grew up in Frederick OK, a small farming town of about 7000 people. My dad owned his own business. The town prospered economically only if the farmers had successful crops. Needless to say, money was always an issue for my family and I grew up with concern that there would not be money for me to attend college. In the fall of 1961, I was a finalist for appointments to the Naval and Coast Guard Academies but received neither. I was very disappointed but refused to accept the possibility that I would not be able to attend college for financial reasons. Most likely, I enrolled as a freshman at Okla. State University because of a recommendation from one of my high school counselors with encouragement that some way somehow financial challenges would not stop me if I worked hard and refused to give up. I suspect that everyone can remember people, such as my high school counselor, who has made a difference in their lives. I believe that so often the little things we do for or say to others have a profound influence on their careers and success in life, whether it be positive or negative. In my life, it was a few simple words of belief and encouragement by a 9th-grade math teacher that my math skills would enable me to become an engineer. An aunt once told me I was great at fixing things and figuring out how to make things work. A college professor hired me as a sophomore to work half-time in his research lab. A different college professor introduced me to a universal computer simulation program and then took extra time to help me understand and believe that I could use it to analyze and solve just about any kind of engineering dynamics problem. Another college professor encouraged me to apply for the Ph.D. program at MIT; his words of encouragement and belief in me gave me confidence that I could complete the program. The list of people of positive influence in my life goes on and on. Ive always known that I wanted to be such a person of influence to others but I had no idea how I could do it. I was offered several teaching positions while I was working on my Ph.D. But, at that time I was working half time at a consulting firm while going to school and was not considering a teaching profession. In the spring of 1969, the space race was coming to a climax, the Country was engaged in the Vietnam War, and the cold war was a high priority for the defense industry; jobs were bountiful. I was excited about being involved in advancing technology and protecting our freedom and way of life in the USA. I accepted an engineering position with General Dynamics in Ft. Worth. On July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon; two weeks later I turned in my dissertation drove out of Cambridge headed to Texas by way of NY City to see a ticker tape parade for Armstrong and the other two astronauts. I truly believe that my interest in teaching began that first year while working in the defense industry. Utilizing the computer simulation tools that I learned at OSU and the stochastic algorithms I learned at MIT, I was immediately involved in simulating and analyzing inertial navigation and weapon delivery systems for the Cruise Missile, the F11 Bomber, and the B1 Bomber. I was using computer algorithms that none of my fellow workers understood or had ever used. My first year at General Dynamics was very educational, exciting, and very revealing to me as an engineer. So, in the spring of 1970 when Carl Files, the head of the Mechanical Engineering Department at UTA, offered me an adjunct position, I was excited about sharing things that I had learned; so, I accepted the position. During that spring semester, I passionately enjoyed teaching algorithms and engineering tools that I was learning to apply to real-world problems. At that time I realized how much I enjoyed teaching things that I love to do. I began to realize that as a teacher I would be in a position to share that passion and inspire students to want to learn and become passionately involved in their work and make a positive difference in their lives. I realized that this was a way to give back what so many had done for me. . .
