After graduating from Caltech with a BS in math and minor in English, I moved to UC Berkeley, where I subsequently earned an MS in computer science and PhD in statistics. I spent two wonderful years as an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania from 2014-2016, after which I moved back to Madison. During the 2019-2020 academic year, I was a visiting professor in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. My current research interests include high-dimensional statistics, optimization, network inference, and robust statistics. I am also interested in statistical applications to medical imaging and epidemiology.
