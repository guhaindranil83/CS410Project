Owen received the B.E.E., M.S.E.E., and Ph. D. degrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1980, 1983, and 1989 respectively. During 1991 he was on a leave of absence and he worked for the telecommunications firm ALCATEL-SEL in Stuttgart, Germany. Between 1992 and 1995, he spent summers performing research for ALCATEL-SEL on site in Stuttgart. At Georgia Tech Dr. Owen has implemented the Internet Programming and Internet Design laboratories and classes that provide networking equipment as well as an environment for hands on laboratory experimentation and project implementation. His hobbies include Amateur Radio, Scuba Diving, and he is a certified Flight Instructor.
