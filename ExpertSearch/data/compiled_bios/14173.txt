These methods are used to study wetland ecosystems across a variety of spatial scales and temporal scales. Professor Warner has studied wetlands in all parts of Canada, the United States, Mexico, Chile, Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, Japan, and Iraq. Contact informationOffice: ESC 309 Phone: 519-888-4567, ext. 38340Email: bwarner@uwaterloo.ca Expertise Wetland ecology, including peatlands Sediment stratigraphy Use of ecological and paleoecological indicators, such as macrofossils and pollen to study wetland ecology Research Dr. Warner is a wetland ecologist and paleoecologist. His research focuses on wetland ecosystem dynamics of natural, restored, and created wetlands. Ecological and paleoecological (analysis of sediment stratigraphy, age dating, and biological indicators such as pollen, plant macrofossils, soil Protozoa) methods are used to study wetland ecosystems across a variety of spatial scales (i.e. local, regional and global) and temporal scales (i.e. seasonal, yearly, centenary and millennial). He has studied wetlands, including peatlands, in all parts of Canada, and wetlands in the United States, Mexico, Chile, Europe, Scandinavia, Russia, Japan, and Iraq. Teaching Professor Warner is the Teaching Fellow for the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. His course offerings include EARTH 336 (winter) Evolution II: Fossil Record EARTH 444 (fall) Applied Wetland Science Highlighted Publications Professor Warner has published more than 100 peer-reviewed publications in wetland science, biogeochemistry,quarternary geology and paleo-environments.
