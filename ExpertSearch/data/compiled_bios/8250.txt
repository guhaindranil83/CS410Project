Burton Swanson Research Professor and Director of the Information Systems Research Program Most people think of technology as physical stuff, but I like to think of it as a capability. burt.swanson@anderson.ucla.edu (310) 825-3654 About Biography Recent Papers Career Publications Other Biography E. Burton Swanson is Research Professor and Director of the Information Systems Research Program at UCLA Anderson School of Management.
