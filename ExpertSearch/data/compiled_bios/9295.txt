Previously, Demanet was Szego assistant professor" (a postdoctoral position) in the Department of Mathematics at Stanford. He obtained his PhD in 2006 under Emmanuel Candes, in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Caltech, and holds undergraduate degrees in mathematical engineering and theoretical physics from the Universite de Louvain, Belgium. A long-time member of MIT's Earth Resources Laboratory, Demanet's research interests include geophysical imaging, inverse problems, scientific computing, and wave propagation. His Imaging and Computing Group studies inverse problems related to wave scattering and high-frequency data, including many questions motivated by real-life challenges in seismic and radar imaging. The groups specific research directions include fast algorithms for wave propagation, applied harmonic analysis, nonlinear signal processing, convex relaxations in optimization, and more recently machine learning for geophysics. Demanet is the recipient of a Sloan research fellowship, a CAREER award from NSF, and a Young Investigator award from AFOSR.
