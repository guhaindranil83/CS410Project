Our laboratory has broad interests, which include, but are not limited to: Understanding the mechanisms that regulate feed intake; Improving nutrient digestion, efficiency of nutrient utilization and conversion into milk and meat; Improving microbial growth in the rumen and their contribution to the animals supply of nutrients (amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and volatile fatty acids); Improving the utilization of commonly used feedstuffs, evaluating alternative ingredients and fine-tuning diet formulation, especially within the context of Floridas agricultural realities; Improving accuracy, precision, and reducing time and cost of laboratorial methodologies as well as evaluating new experimental techniques both in the lab as well as on the field.
