The College of Engineering has identified five strategic research areas that are key global challenges where we can achieve greatest impact and excellence. To promote these research areas, the college's Strategic Research Initiatives (SRI) program builds interdisciplinary collaborations that inspire innovation and focus on innovation leadership through five new collaborative initiatives: Expand All | Collapse All Infrastructure and Smart Cities We live in a time of unprecedented growth in urban populations. Rapid expansion creates significant challenges in stewarding urban network and infrastructure systems including transportation, food, water, and power to ensure that communities are resilient and sustainable. Responding to these challenges, we have a remarkable opportunity to realize innovative and groundbreaking approaches, techniques, and tools to leverage advancements in data science, sensing, communication, and infrastructure design to connect people, communities, and the urban infrastructure in new and productive ways. Read more/less Find UW researchers We envision Seattle and the UW to be leaders in defining the next generation of the "Smart City" in the 21st century, by leveraging technological innovation and human capacity to address holistically the social, economical, and environmental factors that constitute a healthy city. We are building a research coalition to address the complex challenges in urban networks, from infrastructure and transportation to managing climate change, from data science to hazard resilience and disaster response. We imagine Seattle and the UW as critical players in the future of Smart/Wise City research, addressing these critical challenges from multiple perspectives including but not limited to the technology, engineering, and science as well as the humanities, social sciences, and public health. Strategic goal: Make a significant and visible societal impact Current Activities The MetroLab Network The University of Washington and the City of Seattle have joined a new national network of university-city partnerships that will work on Smart City solutions as part of a new White House Smart Cities Initiative.

Strategic goal: Build interdisciplinary collaborations that inspire innovation NSF Visioning Workshop on Smart and Connected Communities Research and Education A confluence of leaders from around the world, including leading industry representatives, to discuss and define a vision for smart and connected communities. Discussions highlight a variety of smart community topics, such as city planning and management; urban infrastructure and systems; emerging technologies; and social, cultural and economic challenges. Strategic Goal: Create Industry and Community Partnerships to Increase Our Impact 2+2 MOU A memorandum of understanding between the State of Washington and the Chinese province of Sichuan as well as the University of Washington and Tsinghua University, to catalyze the science, technology and investment needed to grow innovations that will underpin adaptable and resilient urbanization. Strategic Goal: Focus on key global challenges where we can achieve greatest impact and excellence Engineering and Environment Water availability, purity and management will be the critical 21st century issue for the health and well being of global society. The Puget Sound region represents a national resource for understanding complex demands on water in ecosystems that ranges from mountains to sound to coast, and are set in social contexts ranging from rural to urban and agrarian to industrial. Read more/less Find UW researchers We aim to leverage interdisciplinary strengths in engineering and science related to freshwater at the UW, including substantial recent university investments in hiring new faculty and in supporting a focused initiative on freshwater. Current Activities Freshwater @UW The collaboration between the College of the Environment, the College of Engineering, and UW Tacoma seeks to strengthen freshwater-related science, engineering, resources management, and educational capacity at the UW. The UW Collaborative Innovation Network in Freshwater Sciences and Engineering will coordinate research efforts and leverage UW funding to work on high profile water-related problems at local to international scales and will develop UW Education in Science and the Human Dimensions of Freshwater Issues at both the graduate and undergraduate levels across the UW. Strategic Goal: Build interdisciplinary collaborations that inspire innovation Mountains to Sea An initiative of Freshwater @UW to catalyze and facilitate water sustainability research at UW. Mountains to Sea addresses key questions directly relevant to the Pacific Northwest; efforts which can then be translated to national and global scales. The initiative is a joint venture of interdisciplinary faculty whose research areas include hydrology, carbon cycling, fisheries, and aquatic ecology, estuarine hydrodynamics, and contaminant fate. This initiative will facilitate interaction and generate new interdisciplinary research directions within the entire water sciences community at the UW. Strategic Goal: Focus on key global challenges where we can achieve greatest impact and excellence Engineering and Energy The College of Engineering is helping to advance the adoption of a clean energy future by developing next generation solar energy and electrical energy storage materials, devices and systems, as well as their integration with the grid. Read more/less Find UW researchers Collaborative efforts with the State of Washington, the Clean Energy Institute, and the Washington Research Foundation to advance the adoption of a clean energy future. Research efforts include next-generation solar energy and electrical energy storage materials, devices and systems as well as their integration with the grid. We are recruiting top students and faculty to campus to leverage CEI resources and significantly increase the scope and impact of UW research and education activities in clean energy. We are also fostering synergies and partnerships that grow our international visibility and prominence in clean energy research, education, and technology translation. Current activities Clean Energy Institute The Clean Energy Institute (CEI) at UW is accelerating the creation of a clean energy economy and will grow Washingtons capacity for a sustainable economy and environment. Strategic goal: Make a significant and visible societal impact Pacific Marine Energy Center The Pacific Marine Energy Center aims to facilitate commercialization of marine energy technology, inform regulatory and policy decisions, and close key gaps in scientific understanding with a focus on student growth and development. Strategic goal: Provide an educational experience that prepares our students to be leaders National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure The National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI) site at UW is designed to give researchers from academia, small and large companies and other institutions open access to university facilities with leading-edge fabrication and characterization tools in the clean energy and biotechnology areas. Strategic goal: Create industry and community partnerships to increase our impact Engineering and Health With the recent focus in U.S. policy on value and accountability in healthcare, there has never been a more opportune time for researchers, engineers, clinicians, and entrepreneurs to contribute to the development of medical and dental technology for the purpose of lowering costs and improving the quality of care. Read more/less Find UW researchers The University of Washington is uniquely equipped to be the world leader in this effort with high nationally ranked bioengineering, mechanical engineering, electrical & computer engineering, chemical engineering, and schools of business, medicine and dentistry. New institutes will bridge the boundaries between engineers and healthcare practitioners by integrating research, student projects, clinical practice, and commercialization to train leaders in healthcare innovation. New technological solutions will help improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare while reducing costs. Existing faculty and new cluster hires will be recruited to facilitate translational research and foster a culture of innovation in healthcare technology.
