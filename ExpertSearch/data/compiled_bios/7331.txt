Dr. Kenneth P. Sebens is a Professor in the Department of Biology and School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington. He is currently resident at the UWs Friday Harbor Laboratories (since 2005) and was Director of FHL from 2005 to 2013 and Dennis Willows Directors Endowed Professor (2011-2013). Dr. Sebens received his BA from the University of Connecticut in 1972 and his PhD from the University of Washington in 1977. During 1977-2005 he held faculty positions at Harvard University, Northeastern University, and the University of Maryland College Park, and was Dean at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and Director of Northeastern's Marine Science Center. He conducts research on marine subtidal benthic populations and communities in both temperate and tropical locations. Dr. Sebens has published widely on marine biological and ecological topics and has mentored 32 graduate students at four universities since 1978, many of whom now have careers as university faculty and research scientists. Ongoing projects include investigations of community and population dynamics, and long-term change, in rocky subtidal habitats in Massachusetts, Washington State, and in the Mediterranean Sea.
