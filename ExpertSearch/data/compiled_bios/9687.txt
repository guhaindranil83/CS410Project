Using my background in computer engineering as well as computing theory, I have conducted research in various emerging areas, most recently data science and cybersecurity. I have published more than 100 research publications, many of which have appeared in top venues such asIEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC)andIEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (ToN). I have served as a technical program committee co-chair for several international conferences and as an editor of many renowned journals. I am a Senior Member of IEEE and ACM.
