Primarily, she studies the use of hydrological models to simulate flow and contaminant transport, including the thermal regime, for prediction, management, and process investigation. Her research emphasizes the holistic nature of all natural and engineered systems, seeking to balance competing water demands, such as energy production, and agricultural and urban development to maintain economic, social, and environmental stability.

She develops, integrates, and uses a wide variety of tools, ranging from computationally demanding, fully-integrated, physically-based surface/subsurface hydrological models and multi-component reactive transport models to computationally frugal analytical solutions, to meet this objective. Her research goals stem from an interest in developing effective and efficient tools for water resource management and planning, and closing the gap between cutting-edge scientific tools and those utilized by resource managers, industry, and other stakeholders.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
