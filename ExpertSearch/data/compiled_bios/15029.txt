Brady Michael J. Fitzpatrick Distinguished Professor of Photonics in the Edmund T. Pratt, Jr. School of Engineering David Brady leads the Duke Information Spaces Project (DISP). Historically, DISP has focused on computational imaging systems, with particular emphasis on smart cameras for security, consumer, transportation and broadcast applications. Currently DISP focuses primarily on the use of artificial intelligence in camera arrays for interactive broadcasting. Appointments and Affiliations Michael J.

California Institute of Technology, 1986 B.A. Macalester College, 1984 Research Interests Professor Brady's research focuses on "smart cameras" which use artificial intelligence to increase the amount of visual information captured and to render this information useful. In 2012 his group built the world's first gigapixel camera, his work today focuses on making gigapixel media and interactive virtual reality broadcasting ubiquitous.
