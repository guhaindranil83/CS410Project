People Dr Morteza Varasteh People Dr Morteza Varasteh Lecturer School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (CSEE) Email m.varasteh@essex.ac.uk Location 5B.523, Colchester Campus Academic support hours Wednesdays 9-11 am Profile Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Teaching and supervision Publications Contact Profile Biography Morteza Varasteh received the BSc degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Tabriz University, Tabriz, Iran, in 2009, and the MSc degree in Communications Systems Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2011. During 2011-2013 he worked as a research engineer in Zaeim Electronic Industries conducting a project on implementing the physical layer of IEEE 802.16. He received his PhD degree in Communications from Imperial College London, London, UK in 2016. He was a research associate in Imperial college from 2017 to 2019 working on the EPSRC-funded project "Simultaneous Information-Power Transfer". He is currently a lecturer (assistant professor) in the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (CSEE) Department, University of Essex, Colchester Campus, UK. His research interests lie in the general area of information theory, wireless communications, optimization theory and machine learning.
