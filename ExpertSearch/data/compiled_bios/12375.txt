Bio I am an applied statistician with a primary focus in biostatistics. My main interest is in applications to occupational and environmental health settings, although I have had the privilege of working with a broad spectrum of researchers from many disciplines. My methodological work has primarily been in smoothing methods for estimating non-linear exposure-response relationships in different contexts, such as survival models and functional linear models.
