He received both his M.Eng. and B.Eng. degrees from Dalian University of Technology, China. Dr. Wu is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Georgia State University. Dr. Wus research focuses on big data analytics, data mining, and bioinformatics. He is especially interested in analyzing and mining large-scale networks and their applications in biomedical and social domains. Graphs are ubiquitous data structures that can model many real-world problems. Measuring similarity between nodes and detecting community structures in graphs are two fundamental problems in graph analysis. Dr. Wu is especially interested in applying random walks on graphs to design effective similarity measures and community detection methods. He is also interested in developing efficient computing algorithms for processing large-scale graphs. For example, he designs Monte Carlo methods for computing random-walk-based similarity measures. These Monte Carlo methods are randomized algorithms that can be deployed in distributed systems for processing large-scale graphs.
