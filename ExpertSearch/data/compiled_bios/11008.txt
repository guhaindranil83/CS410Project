We combine experimental, theoretical, and computational methods to analyze emergent properties in complex materials and interfaces, including active colloidal suspensions and living biological systems like bacterial biofilms and mammalian cell membrane interfaces. We aim to advance fundamental understanding of complex fluids and matter at the intersection of materials science, physics, and bioengineering.
