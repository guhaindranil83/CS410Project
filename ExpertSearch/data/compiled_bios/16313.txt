Upon receiving his degrees, Dr. Baron remained at the University of Paris, where he went on to become a member of the dental faculty. He was first appointed as an assistant professor in physiology, was soon promoted to an associate professor of physiology, and became chief of the Physiology Section. Dr. Baronhas taken office as the new president of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), the worlds leading scientific organization for bone health research. Dr. Baron will serve as President of ASBMR until October 2015. In 1975, Dr. Baron began a long career at Yale University School of Medicine. He held several positions at Yale, beginning as an assistant professor in pathology. He soon moved to the Department of Internal Medicine and Cell Biology and climbed through the ranks to eventually become a tenured full professor. In 2008, he left Yale to become the chair of the Department of Oral Medicine, Infection, and Immunity at Harvard School of Dental Medicine. In addition to being chair, Dr. Baron is also a professor of oral medicine, infection, and immunity and a professor of internal medicine at Harvard Medical School and at the Endocrine Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Baron is the founder and current editor-in-chief of Bone, the Official Journal of the International Bone and Mineral Society. Between 1994 and 2002, he also held the position of vice president and head of the Bone Diseases Group at Hoechst Marion Roussel and then Aventis.

His research is the basis for the development of novel therapies to prevent bone loss such as that in arthritis and osteoporosis. The Baron Laboratoryis focused on signal transduction and the ways in which it controls cell differentiation and function. For this purpose, the researchers primarily study skeletal development and remodeling as a model system.
