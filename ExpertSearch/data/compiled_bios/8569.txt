Her research examines such questions as how focusing on time (rather than money) increases happiness, how the meaning of happiness changes over the course of ones lifetime, and how much happiness people enjoy from extraordinary and ordinary experiences. Across these inquiries, her findings highlight the high level of happiness that stems from personally connecting with people and with the present moment.

Professor Holmes developed and teaches the popular course Applying the Science of Happiness to Life Design, which helps students thrive in their personal and professional lives. Pulling insights from research in psychology and behavioral decision making, as well as her own research, this course provides students with ideas and tools to apply to improve their day-to-day living and the design of their career and life overall. Prior to joining UCLA Anderson, Professor Holmes was a tenured faculty member at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was an award-winning teacher of Strategic Brand Management.
