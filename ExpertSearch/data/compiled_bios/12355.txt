His main research interests are in probability theory, with a focus on heavy tailed stable distributions. He is also interested in problems in finance, engineering, and genetics. He was a co-PI in the Math for America DC program, a program to train skilled mathematics teachers for the DC public schools. While not doing math, he enjoys outdoor activities, reading and acoustic music.
