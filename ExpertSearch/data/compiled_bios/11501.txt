His research focuses on discrete damage modeling methodologies for laminated composites under a broad range of loading conditions, including compression and fatigue. He also focuses on integrated computational materials science and engineering which brings together manufacturing and performance aspects of advanced composite materials. Among his achievements, Iarve was awarded the Exceptional Performance Award and the Wohllenben/Hochwalt Professional awards from UDRI. Iarve also works in collaboration with the NASA Langly Research Center and the Skolkovo Institute of Technology in Moscow. He has been a speaker and panel participant at numerous national and international workshops and universities including UTA, SAMPE, the Conference on Composites Testing and Model Identification, the Conference of Advances in Multiscale Modeling of Composite Materials Systems and Components, the Strength and Prediction of Composite Bolted Joints and the Advisory Group for Aerospace Research & Development Structures and Materials Panel. Iarve received his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering at St. Petersburg University in Russia. He received his M.S. and B.S. at Latvian State University, Latvia. Iarves recent position was as a professor for the School of Engineering where he also held the title of distinguished research engineer and group leader for Advanced Composites-Analytics at the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI).

Duties include cooperative curriculum and research development activities with the Skolkovo Institute of Technology, Moscow, Russia. Oct 2011to Oct 2015 Group Leader University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI) ACA group consists of four PhD, one MS and BS level researchers and one MS graduate student. ACA research encompasses characterization and evaluation of reinforcing fibers and preforms of different fiber architectures, matrix resins, and composites; experimental and analytical mechanics of composites and development of novel computational techniques and tools. New areas include high-temperature composites and ceramics and their durability in extreme environments; Integrated Computational Materials Science and Engineering (ICMSE) with emphases on processing science and composites performance linkage. May 2000to May 2015 Distinguished Research Engineer UDRI The primary duties involve identifying research opportunities in the broad area of advanced composite materials and their applications as well as performing advanced research and development in these areas. The research was directed towards basic understanding of deformation and failure mechanisms of current and emerging composites as well as design recommendations and allowables selection process. New methodology of Discrete Damage Modeling in laminated composites has been developed and found support and application outside the AFRL, namely NASA, NAVAIR and industrial companies have become sponsors for this advanced methodology. May 1995to May 2000 Senior Research Engineer UDRI Developed numerical and analytical techniques for three-dimensional stress analysis in multilayered orthotropic media based on unconventional displacement approximation techniques such as B-spline approximation and its combination with asymptotic solutions. Further development and application of these techniques formed a cornerstone of a unique area of expertise and led to a formal alliance between the Air Force Research Laboratory, major airframers and aircraft engine manufacturers and UDRI. Seven technical workshops were held on annual basis to facilitate the technology transfer process. An editorial article Recent Advances in Bolted Composite Joint Strength Prediction, appeared in The AMTIAC Newsletter, 2000, reviewing milestones of this program. Apr 1991to Apr 1995 Research Scientist AdTech Systems Research Inc Served as a principal investigator on the following research projects: Spline Variational Elastic Laminate Technique (SVELT) for three-dimensional analysis in composite bolted joints and progressive damage modeling: stress analysis in composite plates with preformed holes: spline approximation-based postprocessing program to recover interlaminar stresses from a nonlinear finite element solution (DYNA3D) in composite fan blades subjected to bird strike; and transverse wave propagation in composite plates under high velocity impact June 1989to Mar 1991 Engineer-Designer Engineering and Technology Center of the Latvian Academy of Sciences Apr 1983to May 1989 Assistant and Associate Research Scientist Institute of Physics, Latvian Academy of Sciences Prior to arriving to the United States, I conducted research in the area of thin-film adhesion, viscoelastic composite modeling, and the impact response of composite materials.
