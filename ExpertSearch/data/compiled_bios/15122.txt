I moved to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2013, and now I am a Professor with Data Science Founder Professorial Scholar. Research Interests Methods Univariate and multivariate spatio-temporal data modeling Bayesian hierarchical modeling Functional data methods Copula Spatial extremes Applications Paleoclimate reconstruction Large data analysis in climatology, atmospheric and environmental science Public health such as HIV, vector-born disease, and heat wave related human morbidity Time series data analysis Research DescriptionMy research mainly focuses on spatial and spatio-temporal statistics and environmental statistics concerning problems in climatology, atmospheric sciences, public health, forestry and agriculture.
