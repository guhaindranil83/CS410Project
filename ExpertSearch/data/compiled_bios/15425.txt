Schoenung, the JMS Research Group is located at the University of California, Irvine, located between the cities of Irvine and Newport Beach in Orange County. We are approximately 45 minutes south of Los Angeles and 15 minutes inland from the Pacific Ocean. The JMS Research Group synthesizes, characterizes and models new materials to meet the increasing demands of ballistic, transportation, and energy applications. The group is also involved in a Green Engineering initiative, investigating the impacts of materials transactions on human health and environmental quality. Current research focuses on deformation mechanisms of magnesium alloys, investigation of laser engineered net shaping (LENS) fabrication methods, LENS fabrication of battery materials, processing and properties of high entropy oxide (HEO) ceramics, and investigation of sustainability in materials manufacturing processes.
