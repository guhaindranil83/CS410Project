James Career Development Professor Associate Professor, Operations Research and Statistics 01. Biography 01.Biography 02.Publications 03.Articles & Press About Academic Groups Operations Research and Statistics Academic Area Management Science Rahul Mazumder is theRobert G. James Career Development Professor and Associate Professor of Operations Research and Statistics at the MIT Sloan School of Management.Prior to joining MIT, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics, Columbia University from Fall 2013 through June 2015, and was also affiliated with the Data Science Institute, Columbia University. Prior to that, Rahul was a PostDoctoral Associate at MIT from 2012 - 2013.His research interests are in data science, statistical machine learning, large scale optimization, mathematical programming; and in particular, their interplay. He is also interested in "big data" applications in environmental and climate studies, social science, and recommender systems. He has published in a variety of journals: Journal of Machine Learning Research, Annals of Statistics, Journal of the American Statistical Association,and Annals of Applied Statistics, among others.Rahulcompleted his BS and MS in statistics from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata in 2007. He received his PhD in statistics from Stanford University in 2012. Honors Mazumder wins INFORMS prize Rahul Mazumder has won the 2020 INFORMS (Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences) Optimization Society Prize for Young Researchers. His winning paper, Fast Best Subset Selection: Coordinate Descent and Local Combinatorial Optimization Algorithms (Operations Research 68(5):1517-1537, September-October 2020), was co-authored with his MIT ORC (Operations Research Center) PhD student Hussein Hazimeh. The citation notes:The paper presents a novel algorithm for the Best Subset Selection problem (BSS)a fundamental problem in high-dimensional statistics, where sparse solutions with good explanatory power are crucial for practical use. Yet, it is NP-hard andlabeled computationally intractableThe authors combine tools and techniques from high-dimensional statistics, continuous optimization, integer programming, and open-source software development to provide the community with a highly effective heuristic for BSS, one which has strong theoretical underpinnings, outperforms existing state-of-the-art codes in many cases, and is easy to generalize to other settings. Read More Mazumders research honored by Office of Naval Research Rahul Mazumder is the recipient of a 2018 Young Investigator Program (YIP) Award from the Office of Naval Research (ONR). Known as one of the oldest and most selective U.S. science and technology basic research programs, the ONR YIP funds early-career academic researchers (investigators) whose scientific pursuits show outstanding promise for supporting the Department of Defense, while also promoting their professional development. The awards were announced last week. Mazumder is one of five MIT awardees among the 31 scientists chosen from a broad spectrum of technical fields, whose research was deemed to hold strong promise across a wide range of naval-relevant science and technology areas, based on past performance, technical merit, potential for scientific breakthrough and long-term university commitment. Mazumders three-year project, entitled Combinatorial Statistical Inference with Mathematical Optimization, will create new methodology to address key inferential problems central to modern applied statistics and data science, using techniques in mathematical optimization. This new methodology could then be applied to a wide range of problems in support of the U.S. Navy and Department of Defense.
