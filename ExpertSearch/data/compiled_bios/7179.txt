He joined the ECE faculty at Georgia Institute of Technology in December 1999. His main research focus has been in the area of Integrated MEMS and Microsystems Technology. He has served on the technical program committees of the IEEE International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), IEEE Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Conference, International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM), and Transducers and IEEE Sensors Conference. He is an editor for IEEE/ASME Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems (JMEMS). Dr. Ayazi is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Qualtr Inc., a spin-out from his research Laboratory that commercializes bulk-acoustic-wave (BAW) silicon gyroscopes and multi-degrees-of-freedom inertial sensors for consumer electronics and personal navigation systems.
