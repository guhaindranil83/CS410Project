He received his MEng and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, where he maintains an Honorary Lecturer position. His research interests lie in the development of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems and smart structural integrity assessments through the Digital Twin concept. His research covers electromagnetic and ultrasonic methods, analytical and experimental techniques and the development of both hardware and software solutions. He has expertise in integrating structural health monitoring data with probabilistic structural integrity assessments to provide real-time, uncertainty-quantified diagnostics and prognostics.PublicationsPeer Reviewed Publications Corcoran J.;Leinov E.;Jeketo A.;Lowe M.J.S.
