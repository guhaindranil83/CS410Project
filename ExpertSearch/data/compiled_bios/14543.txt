He is also a member of the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology. His research focuses on theory and simulations involving the self-assembly of nanostructured polymers, such as block copolymers, liquid-crystalline polymers, polyelectrolytes and polymeric brushes. While he continues to build on his reputation for self-consistent field theory (SCFT), Professor Matsen is currently developing the next generation of theoretical techniques, specifically field-theoretic simulations (FTS). Professor Matsen has published over 135 papers in refereed journals, generating more than 13,500 citations and an h-index of 55. He is also an editor for Physical Review Letters and the European Physical Journal E: Soft Matter. His research record has earned him an international reputation, which was acknowledged by the American Physical Society in 2008 when he was made a fellow for his seminal contributions to the development and implementation of the self-consistent field theory for block-copolymer materials and polymeric brushes.Research InterestsMolecular self-assembly in polymeric systemsBlock copolymersPolymeric brushesSelf-consistent field theoryLattice polymer simulationsField-theoretic simulationsEducation1992, Doctorate, Physics, University of Guelph1987, Bachelor's, Mathematical Physics, Simon FraserCourses*CHE 220 - Process Data AnalysisTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017CHE 620 - Applied Engineering MathematicsTaught in 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsBlaber, S and Mahmoudi, P and Spencer, RKW and Matsen, MW, Effect of chain stiffness on the entropic segregation of chain ends to the surface of a polymer melt, The Journal of chemical physics, 150(1), 2019Blaber, Steven and Abukhdeir, Nasser and Matsen, Mark, Backfolding Transitions in a Liquid Crystalline Polymer Brush, Bulletin of the American Physical Society, 2019T.
