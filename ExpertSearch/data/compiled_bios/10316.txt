He worked at the Universit de Lige, Belgium, and Queens University, Canada, before taking a faculty position in 1992 at Waterloo, where he is now a Professor in Systems Design Engineering and the Canada Research Chair in Biomechatronic System Dynamics. Dr. McPhee is Canadas foremost researcher in the field of multibody system dynamics, with principal application to the analysis and design of vehicles, mechatronic devices, biomechanical systems, and sports equipment. He pioneered the use of linear graph theory to model multi-domain dynamic systems, and his research algorithms have been commercialized by Maplesoft and are a core part of the MapleSim engineering package, which is used by thousands of engineers and researchers at Toyota, NASA, Ford, Honda Motorcycle, General Motors, Harley Davidson, TRW, and others. Dr. McPhee has won several research awards, including the I.W. Smith Award, the Premiers Research Excellence Award, and Best Paper Awards from the American and Canadian Societies for Mechanical Engineering and the International Society for Terrain-Vehicle Systems. He has also received awards for his teaching, written over 200 peer-reviewed papers, consulted to many industries in Canada and the United States, and appeared as an expert witness in the Federal Court of Canada. He has supervised 70 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and is a registered Professional Engineer in the Province of Ontario. Dr. McPhee has served as the Associate Editor for seven international journals, two of which he helped to found Multibody System Dynamics and the ASME Journal for Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics which are the two flagship journals in this field. He has given invited keynote presentations around the globe, delivered webinars on automotive system modelling to thousands of practicing engineers, and in 2005 he was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Dr. McPhee was a co-founder of the Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research (WatCAR) and, during his 2007-2009 tenure as the Executive Director, he grew WatCAR from a fledgling research centre to the largest academic cluster for automotive engineering research in Canada, garnering international recognition and over $10 million in annual funding. Following this tenure, he was the first academic to spend a sabbatical year at the Toyota Technical Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he launched his NSERC/Toyota/Maplesoft Industrial Research Chair in Mathematics-Based Modelling and Design. He is a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering and the Canadian Society of Mechanical Engineers. In 2014, Dr. McPhee received the prestigious NSERC Synergy Award from the Governor-General of Canada.Research InterestsModelling and simulationMultibody dynamicsBiomechanicsVehicle system dynamicsMechatronicsMechanism and machine designComputational methods for dynamic analysisSports engineeringDesign optimizationSystems theoryAutonomous and Connected CarAutomotiveHybrid electric vehiclesApplications in Robotics and Mechatronic SystemsAdvanced ManufacturingRoboticsEducation1990, Doctorate, Mechanical Engineering, University of Waterloo1986, Master's, Mechanical Engineering, University of Waterloo1984, Bachelor's, Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Nova Scotia1982, Certificate of Applied Science, Certificate of Applied Science, Acadia UniversityCourses*BME 182 - Physics II - DynamicsTaught in 2016SYDE 750 - Topics in Systems ModellingTaught in 2015, 2016, 2018SYDE 553 - Advanced DynamicsTaught in 2015, 2016SYDE 652 - Dynamics of Multibody SystemsTaught in 2015, 2017, 2019BME 450 - Sports EngineeringTaught in 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsMehrabi, Naser and McPhee, John and Azad, Nasser L, Design and evaluation of an observer-based disturbance rejection controller for electric power steering systems, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 230(7), 2016, 867 - 884Banerjee, Joydeep and McPhee, John, Graph-theoretic sensitivity analysis of multi-domain dynamic systems: theory and symbolic computer implementation, Nonlinear Dynamics, 2016, 1 - 25McNally, William and Balzerson, Daniel and Wilson, Daniel and McPhee, John, Effect of Clubhead Inertial Properties and Driver Face Geometry on Golf ball Trajectories, Procedia Engineering, 147, 2016, 407 - 412Laschowski, Brock and McPhee, John, Quantifying Body Segment Parameters Using Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry: A Paralympic Wheelchair Curler Case Report, Procedia Engineering, 147, 2016, 163 - 167Taghavipour, Amir and Vajedi, Mahyar and Azad, Nasser L and McPhee, John, A Comparative Analysis of Route-Based Energy Management Systems for Phevs, Asian Journal of Control, 18(1), 2016, 29 - 39In the NewsResearch partnership gives Canada competitive edge in hybrid vehicle designProfessor honoured with medal for engineering excellence TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
