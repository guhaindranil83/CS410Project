He is particularly interested in problems of mathematical biology, biophysics and the mechanics of biology. Current research interests include: (1) growth and remodeling or biological tissue, cell adhesion and cell mechanics (2) stress-defect interactions and transport in semiconductor/microelectronic materials, and (3) multiscale aspects of material behavior with an emphasis on plasticity at small scales.

MICDE awarded a Clare Boothe Luce grant for fellowships to support women in STEM12/07/2018 The program aims to encourage women to enter, study, graduate and teach in science, and the funding will support female PhD students who make use of computational science in their research. Patterning and Morphology in Biological and Nonliving Systems10/07/2017 Understanding the ways in which materials deform and develop stresses and how they respond to those stresses is relevant both to biological as well as nonliving systems, including lithium-ion batteries, other semiconducting devices and alloys used for structural applications, such as automobiles, aircraft and buildings. Garikipati relaunches on-line course "The Finite Element Method for Problems in Physics" on Coursera12/16/2016 This course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences.
