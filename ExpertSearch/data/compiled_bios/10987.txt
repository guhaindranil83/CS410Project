Faculty Kalle Levon Research Professor Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Connect Kalle Levon is an expert in the field of organic electronics, with particular interest in medical diagnostics. Using organic electronics as early-stage cancer markers, Levon focuses his efforts on assisting medical doctors with point-of-care diagnostics. Levon joined the faculty of Polytechnic Institute of NYU in 1989 as an assistant professor of polymer chemistry. He became an associate professor in 1993 and department head in 1995. He successfully pioneered the departments transition from chemistry to biological sciences and engineering and introduced degree programs in biomedical engineering, biomedical sciences, and bioinformatics. During this time, he also became head of the Polymer Research Institute (1996-2003). As associate provost of research and intellectual property (2003-2006), Levon focused primarily on the Institutes patent portfolio. While in this position, he founded the Brooklyn Enterprise for Science and Technology (BEST). He developed courses in biosensors, tissue engineering, sequence analysis, and protein structure/property relationship. His $5 million in research funding during a 10-year period led to novel discoveries in bacteria, virus, protein and DNA detection. Levon earned his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Organic Chemistry from Helsinki University in 1976 and 1981, respectively, and a PhD in Agriculture from Tokyo University in 1986. Levon holds over 15 patents and is the author of numerous published papers on early cancer detection, DNA hybridization, and other immunoassay-type investigations. He serves on the board of The Journal of Nanomedicine and the governing board of Nanomedicine and Drug Delivery Systems. Levon is a member of the National Institute of Healths Biointerfaces and Biomaterials group, which meets three times a year to review over 100 proposal applications in the fields of biosensors, diagnostic devices, and tissue engineering scaffolds. He is also a member of the Biophysical Society, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the American Chemical Society. He is a recipient of the Wechsler Award for Excellence, the Search for Electroactive Materials Award, the Othmer Institute Award and the FiDIPro Finnish Distinguished Professor Award.
