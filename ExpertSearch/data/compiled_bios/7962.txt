She received her B.A. in Physics from Tsinghua University in 2004 and her Ph.D in Astrophysical Sciences from Princeton University in 2010 under the guidance of Dr. Michael A. Strauss. Before joining UIUC in 2015, she was a NASA Einstein fellow at Harvard and a Hubble fellow at UCLA. Research InterestsAstronomical survey and data scienceOrigin and cosmic evolution of galaxies and galactic nucleiThe nature of black holes and gravityMachine learning applications in Astronomy Research DescriptionProfessor Liu studies supermassive black holes that live in the hearts of galaxies across the universe. Understanding how black holes formed and evolved into their present forms has been a central theme in modern astronomy. The next decade will see an array of new facilities and large surveys aimed at addressing fundamental questions centered around this theme. The Liu group develops newobservationaltools anddata analysistechniques in the context of large astronomical surveys. The goal is to understand black holes' origins, growth, ecology, and utilities as astrophysical probes for fundamental physics.
