This diversity stems from the multi-disciplinary nature of the field of robotics, which encompasses aspects of computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, psychology, and many other disciplines. We are proud of the open, friendly culture that has been the hallmark of the Robotics Institute since its inception. Faculty keep their office doors open to encourage informal meetings with students and colleagues. Graduate students organize frequent department-wide social activities, ranging from Friday afternoon get-togethers to white water rafting trips. And the departments strong support for collaboration creates an ideal environment for world class robotics research.
