Levent Degertekin received his B.S. degree in 1989 from M.E.T.U, Turkey; M.S. degree in 1991 from Bilkent University, Turkey; and his Ph.D. in 1997 from Stanford University, California, all in electrical engineering. His M.S. thesis was on acoustic microscopy, and his Ph.D. work was on ultrasonic sensors for semiconductor processing, and wave propagation in layered media. He worked as an engineering research associate at the Ginzton Laboratory at Stanford University from 1997 until joining the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech in spring 2000. He has published over 150 papers in international journals and conference proceedings. He holds 20 U.S. patents, and received an NSF CAREER Award for his work on atomic force microscopy in 2004. Dr. Degertekin served on the editorial board of the IEEE Sensors Journal, and on the technical program committees of several international conferences on ultrasonics, sensors, and micro-opto-mechanical systems (MOEMS). Research interests: Micromachined ultrasonic transducers Medical ultrasound imaging Micromachined sensors with integrated optoelectronic readout Atomic force microscopy Microscale bioanalytical instrumentation Distinctions: IEEE Sensors Journal Associate Editor - 2003-2006 NSF CAREER Award - 2004 IEEE UFFC Society 2004 Outstanding Paper Award - 2005 Sigma Xi Young Faculty Award (Georgia Tech Chapter) - 2005 Woodruff Endowed Faculty Fellow - 2008-2013 M.
