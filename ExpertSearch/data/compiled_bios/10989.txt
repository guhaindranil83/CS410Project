Faculty Shukti Chakravarti Professor of Ophthalmology and Pathology NYU Langone Health Biomedical Engineering Dr. Chakravarti is a Professor of Ophthalmology and Pathology, and Director of Basic Science Research in Ophthalmology. Her research group tries to understand how the extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates cellular functions and tissue homeostasis.In their work they use cell cultures and mouse models to gain a better understanding of the role of neutrophil, macrophage and dendritic cell functions in bacterial and viral infections. In addition, they explore the ECM changes and the underlying genetic causes in corneal diseases. Research Interests: Extracellular matrix (ECM) protein functions in macrophages The ECM in innate and adaptive immunity The ECM in corneal inflammation and wound healing Anterior eye diseases Mouse models of anterior eye diseases Education and Employment 1978 BS.
