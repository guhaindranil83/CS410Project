Biography Research Publications Related News Toggle Accordion Biography AboutFabrizio Lombardi graduated in 1977 from the University of Essex (UK) with a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Electronic Engineering. In 1977 he joined the Microwave Research Unit at University College London, where he received the Master in Microwaves and Modern Optics (1978), the Diploma in Microwave Engineering (1978) and the Ph. D. from the University of London (1982). He is currently the holder of the International Test Conference (ITC) Endowed Professorship at Northeastern University, Boston. At the same Institution during the period 1998-2004 he served as Chair of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Prior to Northeastern University he was a faculty member at Texas Tech University, the University of Colorado-Boulder and Texas A&M University. He has received many professional awards: the Visiting Fellowship at the British Columbia Advanced System Institute, University of Victoria, Canada (1988), twice the Texas Experimental Engineering Station Research Fellowship (1991-1992, 1997-1998) the Halliburton Professorship (1995), the Outstanding Engineering Research Award at Northeastern University (2004) and an International Research Award from the Ministry of Science and Education of Japan (1993-1999).Dr. Lombardi was the recipient of the 1985/86 Research Initiation Award from the IEEE/Engineering Foundation and a Silver Quill Award from Motorola-Austin (1996). Dr. Lombardi was an Associate Editor (1996-2000) of IEEE Transactions on Computers and a Distinguished Visitor of the IEEE-CS (1990-1993). Since 2000, he has been the Associate Editor-In-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Computers. Currently, he is also an Associate Editor of the IEEE Design and Test Magazine and a Distinguished Visitor of the IEEE-CS; he is also the Chair of the Committee on Nanotechnology Devices and Systems of the Test Technology Technical Council of the IEEE.Dr. Lombardi has been involved in organizing many international symposia, conferences and workshops sponsored by professional organizations as well as guest editor of Special Issues in archival journals and magazines such as the IEEE Transactions on Computers, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, the IEEE Micro Magazine and the IEEE Design & Test Magazine. He is the Founding General Chair of the IEEE Symposium on Network Computing and Applications.His research interests are testing and design of digital systems,quantum and nano computing, ATE systems, configurable/network computing, defect tolerance and CAD VLSI. He has extensively published in these areas and edited six books.Research Interests:Testing and design of digital systemsquantum and nano computingATE systemsconfigurable/network computingdefect toleranceCAD VLSIEducationPhD, University of London, 1982Honors & AwardsEditor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions onNanotechnologyFellow, Institute of Electrical and Electronics EngineersSren Buus Outstanding Research Award Toggle Accordion Research Research OverviewFault-tolerant computing, VLSI CAD, testing, configurable computing, distributed systems.Department Research Areas Computer Systems and Software Toggle Accordion Publications Selected PublicationsH.
