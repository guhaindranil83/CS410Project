He attended the University of California, Berkeley where he completed his BA in Physics and Applied Mathematics in 1978. He began his graduate studies at Caltech where he earned his MS degree in Applied Physics in l979 and continued work towards the Ph.D. In 1980 he moved to Carnegie-Mellon University where he completed the Ph.D. in 1983. His studies focused on domain wall dynamics in magnetic bubble memory devices. Between 1983 and 1989 he worked at Harris Corporation in Melbourne, Florida where he developed and applied electrical test methods to Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits. He earned an M.B.A. in 1985 from the Florida Institute of Technology. In 1989 he began work at the University of South Florida as an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering. Dr. Keezer joined the Georgia Tech faculty in l995 and continues to teach classes in Electrical and Computer Engineering and conduct research on the design and test of high performance logic systems. His hobbies include playing the trumpet and numerous sports activities. Research interests: Test methods for high performance electronic systems Design of high speed logic systems Advanced electronics packaging methods Computer applications for music Distinctions: Member, IEEE Member, American Physical Society Intl.
