Allen School of Computer Science & EngineeringResearch focus: social computing, computer-supported cooperative work, computational social science, human-computer interaction, data science New Assistant Research Professor Shuai Zhang Department:Materials Science & EngineeringResearch focus:atomic force microscopy, self-assembly, molecular dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces, interfacial hydration, 2D Van der Waals materials, machine learning Shuai Zhang joins Materials Science and Engineering this fall as an research assistant professor, having previously taught at the department as an acting instructor and research associate. Shuai has advanced protein-material interfaces in his work to design novel protein-inorganic hybrid materials and better understand how protein-crystal interactions can be systematically programmed. New Assistant Teaching Professors Kyle Caldwell Department:Chemical Engineering Research focus:nanoparticles, particular composites Kyle Caldwell is joining Chemical Engineering as the John C. Berg Endowed Lecturer. After receiving his Ph.D. from the UW, he was a senior scientist at Innovative Organics, where he managed a team developing a range of environmentally-friendly chemicals for HDD, IC, LED, automotive and aerospace markets. Sarah Coppola Department:Human Centered Design & EngineeringResearch focus: human factors engineering, system design, gender bias Sarah Coppola joins Human Centered Design and Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where she was a postdoctoral fellow in human factors engineering. In her research, she explores the impacts of bias in technology, such as how gendered differences in interface design can cause a disproportionate number of physical injuries in women. Kristin Dew Department:Human Centered Design & EngineeringResearch focus:technology ethics, design inquiry methods Kristin Dew joins Human Centered Design and Engineering as an assistant teaching professor. Her research is rooted in the sustainability and ethics of interaction design and technology production practices. In her Ph.D. dissertation, she examined the environmental impacts of human-computer interaction, creating methods that center natural resource scarcity and waste materials in interaction design. Penny Hinke Department:Electrical & Computer EngineeringResearch focus:technical and creative writing; public speaking and oral presentations Penny Hinke is joining Electrical and Computer Engineering as an assistant teaching professor, where she has taught advanced technical communication since 2016. Penny received an MFA in creative writing from Goddard College and is a graduate of the Artist Trust EDGE Development Program for Literary Artists. Her work has appeared in literary magazines and journals in the US and the UK. She is currently writing a memoir. Luna Huang Department:Materials Science & EngineeringResearch focus:data science application in materials research, electronic structure study of quantum materials Luna Huang received her Ph.D. in 2006 and has since worked as an engineering project manager and educator. She was the design lead on the Washington state Route 520 East corridor project and has served as an adjunct teaching faculty at Bellevue College and as a lecturer for UW Materials Science and Engineering. She currently serves as a board member on the Washington State China Relations Council, improving the commercial and cultural engagement of Washington state with China. Erik Hurlen Department:William E. Boeing Department of Aeronautics & AstronauticsResearch focus:aerodynamics, future rockets, STEM student engagement Erik Hurlen brings a wealth of experience in undergraduate engineering education to his new role as a teaching associate professor at Aeronautics and Astronautics. He built adaptive learning software for student engagement and performance while at the University of Mississippi, and taught math, physics and engineering at a range of institutions in California, including most recently as a lecturer at San Diego State University. Ryan Maas Department:Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & EngineeringResearch focus:data science, data management and visualization Ryan Maas joins the Allen School as an assistant teaching professor this fall. He previously worked as a research scientist with the UW eScience Institute, software engineering intern at Google, and post-baccalaureate researcher in the UW Department of Astronomy. His teaching focuses on the intersection of data management systems and data science. Irini Spyridakis Department:Human Centered Design & EngineeringResearch focus:Ethics and sustainability in design and engineering, human-computer interaction, infrastructure and smart cities, technology for social good, technical communication, STEM outreach Irini Spyridakis joins Human Centered Design and Engineering where she has taught since 2008. She co-redesigned the technical communication curriculum in 2013, which has been implemented throughout the College of Engineering. In addition to teaching, service, research and outreach, she is the director and co-founder of Meal Matchup, an award-winning software startup that helps UW campus dining halls redirect excess food to local homeless shelters with the help of service learning students. Robbie Weber Department:Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & EngineeringResearch focus:algorithm design, combinatorics, computer science education Robbie Weber remains at the Allen School after receiving his Ph.D., where he primarily teaches theoretical computer science courses. In his research, he designs algorithms for graph problems and studies the classical combinatorial problem of stable matching, which is widely used in matching medical residents to hospitals, and students to high schools.
