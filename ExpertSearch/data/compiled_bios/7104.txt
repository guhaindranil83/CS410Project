From 1995 to 1997, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech. From 1997 to 2002, he was a lecturer at ETH Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland and deputy director of the Physical Electronics Laboratory (PEL). In January 2003, Dr. Brand joined the Electrical & Computer Engineering faculty at Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr. Brand has co-authored more than 120 publications in scientific journals and conference proceedings. His research interests are in the areas of CMOS-based microsystems, microsensors, MEMS fabrication technologies, and microsystem packaging. Research interests: MEMS/NEMS Microsensors for Physical, Chemical and Biological Applications Microsensor Fabrication based on IC Technologies Microsystem Packaging Distinctions: General Co-Chair, 2008 IEEE Int.
