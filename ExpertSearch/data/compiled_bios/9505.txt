Lewis Assoc Professor IR, Bioengineering Leader of public CHO genome sequencing efforts. Expert in systems biology and genome editing technologies. No molecule in a living organism exists in a vacuum. Indeed, each interacts with thousands of other molecules, and the functions associated with each gene product are influenced by surrounding proteins, metabolites, and other molecules. The existence of complex pathways governing phenotypes poses a substantial challenge in efforts to diagnose complex diseases, unravel their causes, and to develop effective therapeutics. The Lewis labuses systems biology approaches to make sense of these complex pathways to develop network-based diagnostics for childhood disorders and to understand the regulation and activity of complex pathways, such as metabolism, protein synthesis/secretion, and glycosylation Capsule Bio: Email:n4lewis@ucsd.edu Office Phone:858-997-5844Lab Website Faculty Profiles NAE Members Endowed Chair Professors Best Teacher Awards Faculty Scholars and Fellows 2020 REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SOCIAL MEDIA JACOBS SCHOOL HOME PROSPECTIVE UNDERGRAD INFO FACULTY DATABASE CONTACT US JACOBS SCHOOL IT SUPPORT FOR FACULTY & STAFF LOGOS & BRANDING UC SAN DIEGO DIRECTORY PRIVACY
