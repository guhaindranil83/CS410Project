In July 2017, he accepted the position of interim associate dean for undergraduate programs in the College of Engineering and was named associate dean in August 2018. From 1985 to 1986, he worked as a lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&M University. In 1986, he joined ABB Network Management Technology Inc., Houston, Texas (formerly Ferranti International Controls Corp.) as a senior engineer, where he designed and developed advanced power system applications software for energy management systems. Since September 1989, he has been with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. His research involves mathematical modeling, simulation, optimization, and reliability evaluation of electric power and energy systems including Distributed Generation (DG) toward the goal of improved decision making under uncertainty. Experience Projects: Optimum Maintenance Strategies for Maximizing the Availability of Wind Farms Modeling and Simulation of the Effects of Distributed Generation Dynamics on Distribution Systems Modeling and Simulation of Distributed Generation with Dynamic Load Conditions Reliability Modeling and Maintenance Optimization of Aging Substations Power System Studies Using Advanced Computer Software Expected Cost Penalty Due to Deviation from the Economic Dispatch for Interconnected Power Systems Selected Publications S.
