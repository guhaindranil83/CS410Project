Before joining the BU Law faculty, Beatrice practiced corporate law at Cooley LLP. Beatrice represented startup companies throughout their life cycles, from formation and day-to-day corporate governance matters through financings and liquidity events, including public offerings and mergers and acquisitions. She additionally represented venture capital investors in private financings and underwriters in public offerings. Beatrice received her JD, magna cum laude, from Boston University School of Law, where she was awarded the Peter Bennett Prize (awarded to the graduating third-year law student with the highest grade point average for that year). She also served as a note editor on the Boston University Law Review. Prior to law school, Beatrice received her BS in Neuroscience from the University of Rochester.

Publisher View all profiles BU Law News The Sociological Realities of Dating Shows My days as dean have always been long, but they have become much longer since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. When I am not working, I often will veg out with my family, read interesting articles, write, play Scrabble (which I never really played before), and try to clear my mind. Barriers that Bend but Dont Break Clara Burrill Bruce ('26) was the only African American woman in her class, and her election to chair of the Boston University Law Review was historic: she was the first woman to head the publication at BU and the first African American to become editor-in-chief of a law review anywhere in the country. Keeping His Eye on the Ball Four months before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Florida, Dan Malasky (01), chief legal officer for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was thinking about the possibility of a work stoppage. Instead of worrying about a virus, he was preparing scenarios related to a potential labor dispute.
