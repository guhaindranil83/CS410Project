The economic faculty bring ideas from economic research (both their own and those from the broader community of economic scholars) to the classroom. The group teaches principles of economics and statistics in managerial foundations classes, as well as applications of economics in classes on strategy, public policy, human resource management, global management, and other topics. The rigorous application of economic principles permeates the MBA, Stanford MSx, and Executive Education curricula. The economics area extends its impact beyond Stanford by publishing, by educating PhD students, and by influencing public policy.

November 2020, Vol. 87, Issue 6, Pages 24732510We generalize the scope of random allocation mechanisms, in which the mechanism first identifies a feasible expected allocation and then implements it by randomizing over nearby feasible integer allocations. The... Journal Article|Economic Uncertainty Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Dave Altig, Scott R. Baker, Jose Maria Barrero, Nicholas A. Bloom, Philip Bunn, Scarlet Chen, Steven J.

Journal Article|Random Inspections and Periodic Reviews: Optimal Dynamic Monitoring Felipe Varas, Ivn Marinovic, Andrzej SkrzypaczReview of Economic Studies.
