She received B.S. (2001) and M.S. (2003) degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade and a Ph.D. (2008) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech. From 2001 to 2003, she was a design engineer for Skyworks Solutions. In 2009, she was awarded the Naval Research Laboratory Postdoctoral Fellowship and spent one year at NRL in Washington D.C. From 2010 to 2012, she was a visiting assistant professor in School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Professor Zaji received the Best Paper Award at ICT'08, the Best Student Paper Award at WCNC'07, and was the recipient of the Dan Noble Fellowship in 2004. She authored Mobile-to-Mobile Wireless Channels, the first book in the field of mobile-to-mobile wireless channel modeling. She serves regularly as a consultant to industry.
