Currently, Chicago Booth has primary responsibility for editing three journals: the Journal of Accounting Research, the Journal of Law and Economics, and the Journal of Political Economy. Historically, four other journals were founded at Booth: Journal of Business, Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Labor Economics, and Quantitative Marketing and Economics. Journal of Accounting Research For more than 40 years, the Journal of Accounting Research has published original research in all areas of accounting using analytical, empirical, experimental, and field study methods. There are five issues per year (March, May, June, September, and December). The May issue (the Supplement) contains only papers presented at the previous years research conference. Learn more Journal of Law and Economics Established in 1958, the Journal of Law and Economics publishes research on a broad range of topics including the economic analysis of regulation and the behavior of regulated firms, the political economy of legislation and legislative processes, law and finance, corporate finance and governance, and industrial organization. The journal has published some of the most influential and widely cited articles in these areas. Learn more Journal of Political Economy The Journal of Political Economy, founded in 1892, is one of the oldest economics journals. The journal presents research on the relationship between government and the economy, and is edited in cooperation with members of the Department of Economics. Articles are published on several areas including monetary theory, fiscal policy, and labor economics and their impact on economics. Learn more The Journal of Business Founded in 1928, The Journal of Business is believed to be one of the first scholarly journals that highlighted business-themed research. The journal covered several areas, including business finance and investment, money and banking, marketing, international trade and finance, and administration. Given the emergence of many specialized business journals, the faculty decided after careful deliberation to cease publication of this more broadly focused journal in 2006. Learn more Journal of Econometrics The late Arnold Zellner, HGB Alexander Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Economics and Statistics, cofounded the Journal of Econometrics in 1973. The Journal of Econometrics is designed to serve as an outlet for important new research in both theoretical and applied econometrics. The scope of the journal includes papers dealing with estimation and other methodological aspects of the application of statistical inference to economic data, as well as papers dealing with the application of econometric techniques to substantive areas of economics. Learn more Journal of Labor Economics Founded in January 1983 by Edward P. Lazear, Glenn MacDonald, George Neumann, and Robert Topel, Isidore Brown and Gladys J. Brown Distinguished Service Professor in Urban and Labor Economics, the Journal of Labor Economics presents international research on the relationship between labor and the economy. Contributors investigate various aspects of labor economics, including supply and demand of labor services, personnel economics, distribution of income, unions and collective bargaining, applied and policy issues in labor economics, and labor markets and demographics. Learn more Quantitative Marketing and Economics Founded in 2003 by Peter E. Rossi, MBA '80, PhD '84, Quantitative Marketing and Economics highlights research in the marketing, economics, and statistics categories. It focuses on problems that are important to marketing using a quantitative approach.Learn more Share This Page The University of Chicago Booth School of Business Explore Why Booth MBA Programs PhD Executive Education Faculty & Research Alumni Recruiters & Companies Events Admissions About Careers at Booth News Chicago Booth Magazine Chicago Booth Review ApplyGiveCampuses Other Offerings UndergraduatesTaking ClassesAll Other Offerings Follow The University of Chicago Booth School of Business 5807 S.
