By analyzing the genes present in various natural microbial communities of water, soil or sediments, he endeavors to make inferences about relationships between the genetic makeup of a particular microbial community and element transformations in that environment and how microbial communities might respond to certain chemical challenges. In essence, his work deals with the role of DNA in the global biogeochemical cycles, including those of such biologically important elements as nitrogen. In addition to his professional interests, Dr. Sobolev is into wildlife photography, sailing, scuba diving, world travel and endurance motorcycle riding.
