We create the science for providing renewable and recyclable alternatives to materials made from petro-chemicals. Our group has made advances indepolymerization of lignin selectivelytobiophenolsand the use of these monomers to make thermoset plastics that can be chemically recycled. We investigate howcatalysts can improve biomass conversion and how monomerstructureaffects the thermal and mechanical properties of materials. Polymers have provided humanity with tremendous benefits from food preservation through packaging to impressive fuel efficiency because of light weight advantage. However, a growing plastics waste problem is requiring creative chemistry to provide recyclable materials and chemical upcycling of currently in use plastics, polyolefins. Wehave ongoing effort in catalytic upcycling of polyethylene to makehigh-valuechemicals. Our group is part of the Energy Frontiers Research Center onMaterials for Water and Energy Systems. We design and prepare polymers containing active sites for capture and release of resources from produced water. Acommon theme in our research group is catalyst design based on understanding of mechanisms on the molecular scale. Graduate students and postdocs in the group are given the freedom to tailor their own projects and are encouraged to collaborate with faculty and peers in other research groups on campus with whom we share common scientific interests.
