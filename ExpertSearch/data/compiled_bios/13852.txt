Dively Award, Harvard Business School, 2003 Biography Dr. Woodard joined Olin from the School of Information Systems at Singapore Management University, where he served as an assistant professor from 2006 to 2015. His research explores the evolution of complex product and system designs, with a focus on the relationship between their architecture and the competitive strategy of their designers. He is especially (but not exclusively) interested in software-based systems, where decisions about interfaces, protocols and standards can turn out to have substantial economic and social consequences. Using a variety of methods including computational simulation and qualitative field studies, he aspires to bridge the gap between engineering design and economic modeling to address situations where the strategic interests of multiple designers are intertwined. Prior to his academic career, Dr. Woodard worked for IBM as a technical evangelist for the companys efforts related to Java, XML and Linux. His interest in these areas was kindled as an undergraduate at Princeton University, where he created an independent concentration in Information Technology and Society after soundly failing at physics and philosophy. At Harvard, he was one of the first and last students to receive a Ph.D. in Information, Technology and Management from a program jointly offered by Harvard Business School and the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
