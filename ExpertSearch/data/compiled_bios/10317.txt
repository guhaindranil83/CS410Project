He is interested in the application of systems theory to field and continuum problems. Professor Savages research aims to produce general models of spatially continuous processes such as heat conduction, diffusion, and elasticity. These models provide conceptual or computational advantages, which unify or categorize existing numerical methods such as finite elements and finite differences. Professor Savages research focuses on the areas of non-linear media modelling, coupled fields, probabilistic boundary conditions and constitutive properties; flexibility and impedance finite elements; and grid optimization methods. Another area of his research is reliability and quality of design, which is in response to the increasing importance of safety and quality objectives as more complex systems are being designed and environmental standards are becoming stricter. The concepts of reliability and quality have proven to be useful in helping quantify constraints and selective alternative designs. Professor Savages research aims to provide a unified methodology for the design of various physical systems that encompass both quality and safety design criteria. The methodology is applicable to multi-disciplinary systems and incorporates several mathematical theories of probability assessment. The research results should provide a design methodology well suited, but not restricted to, the design of systems with active redundancy and dependent component failures. Additionally, it should provide important measures that can be used for the comparison and improvement of designs.Research InterestsModeling & Simulationreliability and quality in designSystems Theory & OptimizationDiscrete Continuum TheoriesMechatronics DesignLarge Systems Modelling through SubsystemsModelling and Optimization of SystemsPattern AnalysisMachine Intelligence & RoboticsEducation1976, Doctorate, PhD, University of Waterloo1970, Master's, MASc, University of Waterloo1968, Bachelor's, BASc, University of WaterlooCourses*SYDE 283 - Physics 3 (Electricity, Magnetism and Optics)Taught in 2015, 2016, 2017SYDE 402 - SeminarTaught in 2015SYDE 462 - Systems Design Workshop 3Taught in 2015SYDE 661 - Model-Based Robust DesignTaught in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019SYDE 351 - Systems Models 1Taught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsSavage, Gordon J and Zhang, Xufang and Son, Young Kap and Pandey, Mahesh D, Reliability of mechanisms with periodic random modal frequencies using an extreme value-based approach, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 150, 2016, 65 - 77Savage, Gordon J and Son, Young Kap, An Extreme-Value Event Approach for Frequency-Domain Performance Reliability, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, 65(2), 2016, 1058 - 1068Son, Young Kap and Savage, Gordon J, Stability Analysis of Uncertain Systems Using a Singular Value Decomposition-Based Metric, International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering, 22(05), 2015Wang, Shujuan and Li, Qiuyang and Savage, Gordon J, Reliability-based robust design optimization of structures considering uncertainty in design variables, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2015, 2015LI, QIUYANG and SAVAGE, GORDON J and SON, YOUNG KAP, Economic, Robust and Quality Design of Engineering Systems using a Hybrid Six Sigma-second Moment Approach., International Journal of Performability Engineering, 11(4), 2015 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
