Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute H. Robert Horvitz analyzes the roles of genes in animal development and behavior, gaining insight into human disease. 617-253-4671 Phone 68-425 Office horvitz@mit.edu Email Lab Website Sally Shin Assistant 617-23-3162 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1974, Harvard University BS, 1968, Mathematics and Economics, MIT Research Summary Our lab examines how genes control animal development and behavior. We use the experimentally tractable nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to identify and analyze molecular and cellular pathways involved in these important areas of biology. Ultimately, we hope to clarify these fundamental biological mechanisms and provide further insight into human disease.
