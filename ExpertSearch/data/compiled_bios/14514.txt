Anderson is a Professor in the Chemical Engineering Department and the former Director of Admissions for the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Waterloo. With his expertise in photochemical (UV) and biological air and water pollution control and biochemical engineering of fermentation and pharmaceutical processes, Professor Anderson maintains industry research collaborations in the areas of hospital air emissions control, clinical water testing, residential air UV disinfection and agricultural resource recovery. His recent projects include automated UV disinfection in hospitals, rapid detection of microbial contamination of water, removal of ammonia from water, and antimicrobial materials for use in engineered infection control. A major emphasis of Professor Andersons work in pollution control technology for air treatment is reactor engineering for photocatalysis and photolysis, using an ultraviolet light irradiated catalyst to degrade organic contaminants at ambient temperatures. In addition to his research work, Professor Anderson has written over 100 journal articles, referred conference proceedings and technical reports. During his time as Director of Admissions, Professor Anderson started a blog about engineering undergraduate admissions which has been widely read by current and prospective Waterloo Engineering undergraduate students. William Anderson is a member of the Waterloo Centre for Microbial Research, the Water Institute, the Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy, and the Tsinghua-Waterloo Joint Research Centre for Micro/Nano Energy and Environmental TechnologyResearch InterestsPhotocatalysisPhotoreaction engineeringAntimicrobial materialsDisinfectionAir pollution controlBiochemical EngineeringBiomedical EngineeringGreen Reaction EngineeringNanoparticle synthesisAdvanced Oxidation Processes for Wastewater and Air TreatmentPhotochemical Reactor EngineeringBiofiltrationWaterEnvironmental EngineeringInfection and Pathogen ControlDevicesEducation1991, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo1986, Master's, Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo1981, Bachelor's, Chemical Engineering, University of WaterlooCourses*CHE 775 - Research Topics in Environmental Engineering and Pollution ControlTaught in 2015CHE 672 - Air Pollution ControlTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 482 - Chemical Engineering Design WorkshopTaught in 2017CHE 572 - Air Pollution ControlTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018CHE 480 - Process Analysis and DesignTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsSanjay Krishna Muralidharan, Lukas Bauman, William A.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
