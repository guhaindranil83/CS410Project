Hariri Building 595 Commonwealth Avenue Boston, MA 02215 Download CV Esther Leibel is an Assistant Professor of Strategy & Innovation at Boston Universitys Questrom School of Business. Her research employs ethnographic and linguistic methods to study the dynamics of fields formation, with a focus on vocabulary, meanings, and practices development in the contexts of entrepreneurship and local investing. Her forthcoming Academy of Management Annals piece with Tim Hallett and Beth Bechky brings attention to the role of interactions as a source of meaning making in fields. Consistent with this view, her analysis of micro-level interactions within the Slow Money movement, which supports the development of sustainable local food systems by connecting sustainable food entrepreneurs with local investors, offers insights into meaning making and practice development as tethering of local understandings to extra local rationales.
