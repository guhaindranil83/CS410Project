Annex Lantheus Medical Imaging Distinguished Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine, ChiefDivision of Cardiovascular Medicine Home Find Faculty Brian H. Annex Bio M.D. Yale School of Medicine, 1985 "We have a program that focuses on specific microRNAs that may serve as unique therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PAD." Brian H. Annex, Brian Annex, MD, is board certified in internal medicine, cardiovascular diseases and interventional cardiology. Prior to his arrival at UVA in July 2008, Dr. Annex served as professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Duke University School of Medicine. While at Duke, he also served as vice chief for the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine. He initiated and then served as director of vascular medicine at Duke as well as a staff cardiologist at the Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center. Dr. Annex's laboratory is a true bench to bedside translational research laboratory that focuses on angiogenesis (the growth and proliferation of blood vessels from existing vascular structures) in the context of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). With this as a focus, he launched a research program that focuses on specific microRNAs that may serve as unique therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PAD in mouse, cell culture, and selected human studies. In addition, he has a continuing NIH funded program using adeno-associated virus-based gene therapy which has mouse, large animal, and human components. He also has two active projects in the area of computational modeling for angiogenesis in PAD. Finally, we have pure human based mechanism testing human studies.
