Digital signal processing (DSP)deals with the nature of information, signals, transforms, and applications. Projects include image/video compression, speech recognition, and image analysis. I also have a DSP project using Google Web Toolkit. Embedded systemsis the umbrella term for computer-controlled devices that are made for a specific purpose. This includes cell phones, MP3 players, control systems in cars, alarm systems, etc. Projects include assistive devices and developing applications for platforms like the iPhone/iTouch. Bioinformaticsis the third area that I work in. It deals with the interdisciplinary fields of computer science, engineering, biology, mathematics and chemistry. There are a lot of fascinating problems caused by the gap between what a human can do and what a machine can do. Projects in this area tend to overlap the other areas. For example, one current project is to automatically find and measure filopodia from a neural image. Publications Ferrol R.
