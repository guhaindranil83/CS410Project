Douglass. After a brief post-doctoral appointment in the same laboratory, he joined the Rochester ECE department in 1985. His research has spanned multiple areas with its current focus on audio and acoustic signal processing. Previous research has been in the areas of electromechanical transducers, image sensors, non-contact ECG sensors, low-noise electronics, digital superconducting electronics, quantum coherent electronics, quantum computing, and quantum noise. He is also the Director of the Center for Emerging and Innovative Sciences (CEIS), a NYSTAR supported Center for Advanced Technology at the University of Rochester with the mission of promoting economic development through joint university-industry research and technology development. Professor Bocko has taught courses on solid state devices, microwaves, circuits and systems, audio signal processing, and acoustics. He was won five teaching awards at the University of Rochester and was named the Mercer Brugler Distinguished Teaching Professor at the University from 2008-2011. He was named Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2013 and served as Chair of the ECE Department from 2004-2010 and again from 2012 to the present time.Research OverviewAudio and Acoustic Signal ProcessingProfessor Bocko's current research focus is in the field of audio and acoustic signal processing. Active research projects include the development of flat panel loudspeakers and spatial audio displays, spatial audio characterization and rendering, efficient modeling of room impulse responses and other acoustic systems, characterization of musical vibrato, and musical expression and computer based musical performance style analysis. Previous research projects include audio source separation and computer music transcription, development of empirically based physical models for musical sound synthesis, compact model-based musical sound representations and audio watermarking and steganography.SensorsProfessor Bocko's earlier research on sensors and transducers began with his PhD thesis on the quantum limits of gravitational wave detectors and back action evasion measurements. Other work in this area includes the development of highly sensitive capacitive displacement sensors and quantum limited electron tunneling displacement sensors. More recent work has been in the areas CMOS image sensors, non-contact electrocardiogram sensors, and micro-power smart sensors for machine health monitoring.SuperconductivityPrevious research projects have employed superconductivity for several applications, including high-frequency digital signal processing circuits and analog circuits for the detection of weak electromagnetic and mechanical signals. In 1996, Professor Bocko's group was the first to propose a realistic design for a quantum computer using superconducting Josephson junction circuits; and subsequently studied quantum coherence in Josephson junction circuits and the use of RSFQ superconducting qubit control electronics and nondestructive readout techniques for superconducting and electromechanical qubits.Honors & Awards2012: University of Rochester, Goergen Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching2008-2011: Mercer Brugler Distinguished Teaching Professor University of Rochester2008: University of Rochester Deans award for Meritorious Service in Ph.D. Education2002: University of Rochester Student Association Senate Professor of the Year2002: UR School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Undergraduate Teaching Award1991: Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching Award, SEAS, University of RochesterMember: APS, IEEE, Audio Engineering Society, Acoustical Society of AmericaRecent PublicationsAnderson, David A., Michael C.
