The course was based on one of the core undergraduate classes in systems analysis (EA3), a class he has innovated through development of classroom experiments. Moreover, he has developed the ME 314 Machine Dynamics course, focusing on the application of variational analysis to simulation and design of mechanisms. He has additionally developed ME 454, an introduction to numerical methods in optimal control. In all these courses, Professor Murphey focuses on project-based learning.
