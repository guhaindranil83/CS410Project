Her research interests include membrane filtration processes, diffusion transport in materials, and enzyme reaction engineering. Professor Moresolis interest in enzyme reaction engineering has led to the optimization of the wastewater treatment process, soil bioremediation, and biomaterial degradation. Her goal is to characterize key enzyme kinetics by understanding the enzymes involved in these complex multiphase processes. Membrane filtration is limited by fouling of the membrane. Professor Moresoli is investigating the causes of fouling through experimentation, along with a systematic mathematical analysis of the transport phenomena and their relationship with the physical characteristics of the feed and target product. In 2010 and 2011, MITACS granted Professor Moresoli $70,000 for her research in membrane fouling and filtration. She then formed a partnership with GE Water and Process Technologies, aiming to develop fluorescence based monitoring strategies to identify and reduce membrane foulants in drinking water treatment applications. An additional project that Professor Moresoli has undertaken is evaluating the suitability of soybean proteins that satisfy the structural and functional criteria for producing industrial films. The biomedical industry is poised to benefit from such a project as protein films can be used to produce wound closures. They can also be used to strengthen plastic materials in the manufacturing of high performance textiles and in biodegradable food packaging applications. In addition to her impressive research contributions, Professor Moresoli also received the Faculty of Engineerings Teaching Excellence Award in 2011.

Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
