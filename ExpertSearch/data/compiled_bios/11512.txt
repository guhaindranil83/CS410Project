Manage 13 direct reports (6 department heads, 3 associate deans, 4 directors), and the UC Simulation Center as the founding director with USD$2.3million/year funding and 75 research students. Accomplishments: Through aggressive marketing, tripling of first-year scholarships and substantial curriculum enhancement; led expansion of College enrollment by 30% while increasing admission standards, attained record quality (academic preparedness) of incoming freshmen class the last 3 consecutive years, and increased percentage of incoming female undergraduate students from 16% to 20%. Substantially enhanced global engagement and international footprint. Examples (1) Created the Joint Engineering Co-op Institute (JCI) in partnership with Chongqing Univ. with 350 engineering students to date (and growing) in this first mandatory co-op program in China generating USD$2million/year in new tuition revenue for UC; (2) Developed a signature dual masters degree program with institutions in Europe and Asia to educate a global engineering workforce; (3) doubling the number of engineering students studying abroad. Significantly improved the finances of the College through increase in enrollment (+30%), research funding (+20%) and philanthropy (+50%) during the last 3 years. In 2012, the College had a performance-based budget deficit of about USD$2million. During the last 3 consecutive fiscal years, the College completed each year with a surplus of USD$2million annually. Initiated faculty hiring campaign (50 in 5 plan hiring at least 50 new faculty in 5 years) fueled by budget surplus, which resulted in an unprecedented 44 new faculty hired in the last 3 years with over 40% female and/or minority faculty, and almost all new faculty hires have affiliation with multiple disciplines. Also, through cross-discipline faculty hiring, jumpstarted 2 key research clusters in data analytics and water. Initiated programmatic and curriculum reform. Select examples infuse innovation and entrepreneurship in undergraduate studies, enrich freshmen curriculum, and re-brand biomedical engineering as an interdisciplinary unit by strengthening alliances with College of Medicine and Cincinnati Childrens Hospital. Collaborated with P&G to expand and enhance UC Simulation Center became the largest interdisciplinary university-industry research center on campus housing 75 research students from 5 difference colleges; received P&G Connect+Develop private/public partnership award; replicated by P&G and Honda at various sites in North America, Europe and Asia; and produced a 7:1 return of investment for P&G.

Managed graduate studies and research operations and resources of the College (i.e. research initiatives and incentives, and graduate enrollment, assistantships and fellowships). Accomplishments: Led the development of the Master of Engineering program (1-year professional masters degree) with capstone project or industrial internship. This degree program now serves as the backbone of the signature dual masters collaboration with international partners in Europe and Asia. Developed a college-wide graduate recruiting and scholarships plan to offer more competitive graduate assistantship and fellowship awards. Collaborated with VP of Research and other research deans to develop a comprehensive campus-wide research plan focusing on 5 key research foci: health, sensing, data analytics, environment and manufacturing. This effort formed part of the Third Century research initiative and also numerous cluster faculty hires 2010to 2012 Director School of Dynamic Systems, University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, United States) 2005to 2010 Department Head Mechanical Engineering (formerly Mech, Indus & Nuclear Engineering), University of Cincinnati Led the largest department in the College with an enrollment of about 800 undergraduate and 300 graduate students, 36 faculty and 10 staff members, $6million/year research funding and 5 research centers. The Department offers B.Sc., M.Sc.(with thesis), M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees. Accomplishments: Led the surge in research funding from USD$1million in 2005 to USD$6million in 2011. Worked with the faculty to expand the number of research centers from 2 to 5 over a duration of 3 initial years of my term as department head. Created the UC Simulation Center in partnership with P&G in 2008, which later expanded into the largest interdisciplinary university-industry research center on campus. Led curriculum reform to modernize curriculum, and enhance efficiency, productivity and relevance to industry. Part of the reform was an introduction of a degree-long project experience to augment the mandatory cooperative education to better prepare students for industry positions. Established the 2+3 co-op based B.Sc.ME program with Shanghai Jiaotong University, China. Students spend 2 initial years at SJTU and the last 3 years at UC with industry-sponsored cooperative experience in North America. Doubled number of undergraduate freshmen while increasing admission standards over time. Transformed the external advisory board into a highly collaborative group by recruiting more corporate executives and senior staff into the membership. This new focus fueled the surge in industry funded research and also increased the quality and quantity of undergraduate students. 2002to 2004 Associate Professor Mechanical Engineering, University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH, United States) 1998to 2002 Adjunct Professor Mechanical Engineering, Ohio State University (Columbus, OH, United States) 1998to 2002 Associate Professor Mechanical Engineering, University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa, AL, United States) 1996to 1998 Research Scientist Center for Automotive Research, The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH, United States) 1993to 1996 Senior Project Engineer Advanced Test and Analysis Group, SDRC (Milford, OH, United States) 1990to 1993 Project Engineer Advanced Test and Analysis Group, SDRC (Milford, OH, United States) 1986to 1989 Graduate Assistant Mechanical Engineering, The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH, United States) 1985to 1986 Graduate Assistant Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Missouri - Rolla (Rolla, MO, United States) 1984to 1985 Undergraduate Teaching Assistant Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Michigan Technological University (Houghton, MI, United States) Memberships 2011to Present American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) member 2006to Present International Society for Optical Engineering member 2003to Present Society of Experimental Mechanics (SEM) member 2002to Present International Institute of Acoustics and Vibration (IIAV) member 2002to Present Tau Beta Pi/ National Engineering Honor Society member 2000to Present American Helicopter Society (AHS) member 1999to Present American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) member 1990to Present Acoustical Society of America (ASA) member 1990to Present Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Fellow 1989to Present American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Fellow 1989to Present Institute of Noise Control Engineering (INCE) member 1984to Present Phi Eta Sigma/ National Honor Society member Awards and Honors Dec 2017 GearLab Distinguished Alumnus Award sponsored by Ohio State University Dec 2017 Honorary Member sponsored by Golden Key International Honor Society Dec 2017 Honorary Member sponsored by Phi Kappa Phi Dec 2015 National Leadership Honor Society sponsored by Omicron Delta Kappa / University of Cincinnati Dec 2014 Fellow of the Graduate School sponsored by University of Cincinnati Dec 2013 Order of the Engineer Fellowship sponsored by University of Cincinnati Dec 2012 P&G Connect+Develop Private/Public Partnership Award sponsored by P&G Dec 2010 Thomas French Alumni Achievement Award sponsored by Ohio State University Dec 2009 Herman Schneider Professorship sponsored by University of Cincinnati Dec 2008 Chang Jiang Scholars Programs Chair Professorship Awarded sponsored by China's Ministry of Education Dec 2006 Fellow sponsored by American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Dec 2006 Fellow sponsored by Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Dec 2005 Excellence in Oral Presentation sponsored by Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Dec 2003 Arch T.
