He obtained his PhD in Chemical Engineering - Nanotechnology from University of Waterloo in 2017. Before joining University of Waterloo at 2020, he was an NSERC postdoctoral fellow at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. During his PhD studies, he was a visiting scholar in the Advanced Materials and Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University, Ohio, USA. During his post-doctoal fellowship, he was a visiting scientist in the Smart Photonic Materials (SPM) research group at the University of Tampere in Finland. Hamed's current research interests revolve around the development of a variety of soft, stimuli-responsive, and programmable materials. In addition, he is interested in emerging fabrication strategies for the manufacturing of small-scale mobile robots and devices, such as direct laser writing, and micro-scale 4D printing.Research InterestsSmart PolymersLiquid Crystal ElastomersSoft Robotic MaterialsMicro Additive Manufacturing 4D PrintingSurface and Interfacial EngineeirngEducation2017, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering (Nanotechnology), University of Waterloo2012, Master of Applied Science, Chemical Engineering (Nanotechnology), University of Waterloo2009, Bachelor of Science (BSc), Chemical Engineering, Sharif University of TechnologySelected/Recent PublicationsShahsavan, Hamed and Aghakhani, Amirreza and Zeng, Hao and Guo, Yubing and Davidson, Zoey S. and Priimagi, Arri and Sitti, Metin, Bioinspired underwater locomotion of light-driven liquid crystal gels, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 117(10), 2020, 5125 - 5133LinkDavidson, Zoey S. and Shahsavan, Hamed and Aghakhani, Amirreza and Guo, Yubing and Hines, Lindsey and Xia, Yu and Yang, Shu and Sitti, Metin, Monolithic shape-programmable dielectric liquid crystal elastomer actuators, Science Advances, 5(11), 2019LinkGuo, Yubing* and Shahsavan, Hamed* and Davidson, Zoey S* and Sitti, Metin (*Equal Contributions), Precise control of lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal alignment through surface topography, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, 11(39), 2019, 36110 - 36117LinkYu, Li and Shahsavan, Hamed and Rivers, Geoffrey and Zhang, Che and Si, Pengxiang and Zhao, Boxin, Programmable 3D Shape Changes in Liquid Crystal Polymer Networks of Uniaxial Orientation, Advanced Functional Materials, 28(37), 2018LinkShahsavan, Hamed and Salili, Seyyed Muhammad and Jkli, Antal and Zhao, Boxin, Thermally Active Liquid Crystal Network Gripper Mimicking the Self-Peeling of Gecko Toe Pads, Advanced Materials, 29(3), 2017LinkJahed, Zeinab and Shahsavan, Hamed and Verma, Mohit S and Rogowski, Jacob L and Seo, Brandon B and Zhao, Boxin and Tsui, Ting Y and Gu, Frank X and Mofrad, Mohammad RK, Bacterial networks on hydrophobic micropillars, ACS Nano, 11(1), 2017, 675 - 683LinkShahsavan, Hamed and Salili, Seyyed Muhammad and Jkli, Antal and Zhao, Boxin, Smart Muscle-Driven Self-Cleaning of Biomimetic Microstructures from Liquid Crystal Elastomers, Advanced Materials, 27(43), 2015, 6828 - 6833LinkShahsavan, Hamed and Zhao, Boxin, Bioinspired Functionally Graded Adhesive Materials: Synergetic Interplay of Top ViscousElastic Layers with Base Micropillars, Macromolecules, 47(1), 2014, 353 - 364Shahsavan, Hamed and Zhao, Boxin, Conformal Adhesion Enhancement on Biomimetic Microstructured Surfaces, Langmuir, 27(12), 2011, 7732 - 7742Guo, Yubing and Shahsavan, Hamed and Sitti, Metin, 3D Microstructures of Liquid Crystal Networks with Programmed Voxelated Director Fields, Advanced MaterialsLinkGuo, Yubing and Shahsavan, Hamed and Sitti, Metin, Microscale Polarization Color Pixels from Liquid Crystal Elastomers, Advanced Optical MaterialsLink TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 6(E6) Phone:519-888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Chemical Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
