Gang Yu and Xiuli He B.E. Sep. 2008 - Jul. 2012 Chongqing University, China Department of Mechanical EngineeringResearch Interests Multiscale and multiphysics modeling for advanced manufacturing.I am interested in the development of three-dimensional thermal-fluid-mechanical models incorporating physics at multiple scales for advancedmanufacturing, such as additive manufacturing of metals and polymer. The model predictions were validated by highly controlled benchmark experiments conducted bytheAir Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) andtheNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Northwestern team led by me wasidentifiedasTop Performerin AFRL Additive Manufacturing Modeling Challenge Series: Micro-scale Process-to-Structure Predictions (2020).My modeling work was also awarded 1st places by NIST for thebest modeling resultspredicting the cooling rate, grain structure and dendritic microstructure in AM-Bench 2018. Mechanisticdata science for engineering.Iam interested in data-driven discoveryfor engineering problems, which is a multidisciplinary field including mechanics, material, physics and computer science. I am developing data-driven methods and theories to understand the relationships between input parameters and final performance of a system and discover reduced-embedded structures and hidden physical laws in the data.Iandmy collaborators in Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) discovered strikingly simple but universal scaling laws using high-fidelity high-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging andmultiphysicsmodeling. Dimensional analysis and machine learning were leveraged to identify a new dimensionless number, Keyhole number, to predict vapor depression aspect ratio and porosity formation in additive manufacturing.Selected PublicationsGan, Z., Kafka, O.
