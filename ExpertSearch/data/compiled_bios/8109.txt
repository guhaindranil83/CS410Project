I taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Southern California, and UC Berkeley before coming to San Jose State in 2004. My research interests are in dynamical systems, subriemannian geometry, foliations, and related areas one could classify as "global analysis". In other words, I like mathematics that blends analysis, geometry, and topology. I have also worked in various fields of applied mathematics such as control theory and quantum computing.
