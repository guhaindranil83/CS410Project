Overview: In the Whiteley Lab, we are interested in the social lives of bacteria. Currently we are utilizing new technologies combined with classical genetic techniques to address questions about microbial physiology, ecology, virulence, and evolution. We primarily study chronic infections involving the pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Our lab is located at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and we are affiliated with the School of Biological Sciences, as well as the Emory-Childrens Cystic Fibrosis Center.
