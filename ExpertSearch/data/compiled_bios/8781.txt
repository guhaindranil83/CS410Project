From 2002 - 2014, she was an assistant and associate professor in Physics at Case Western Reserve University; and from 2014 - 2017, an associate and full professor at the Pennsylvania State University. She joined the Cornell University School of Applied and Engineering Physics as a full professor in 2018.Research InterestsShan's research focuses on the optical and electronic properties of nanoscale materials. Of particular interest are atomically thin two-dimensional crystals (such as graphene and MoS2) and their heterostructures. We develop experimental techniques to probe, image and control the internal degrees of freedom of electrons and their new phases in these nanoscale systems.Various linear and nonlinear optical spectroscopy and microscopy techniques are employed to access both the steady state properties and ultrafast dynamics.Advanced MaterialsColloids and Interfacial ScienceNanotechnologySemiconductor Physics and DevicesSelected PublicationsJ.
