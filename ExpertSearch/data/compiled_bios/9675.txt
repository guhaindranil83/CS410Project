Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine after graduating from the University of New Mexico. She then joined the Olin Neuropsychiatry Research Center and redirected her research interests from the heart to the brain. In 2006, she moved to the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, a research center dedicated to the study of mental illness, and stayed there for 12 years. Dr. Liu Joined GSU in 2019 to start a new phase of her career. Dr. Lius research interests always lie in how to transfer advances in engineering into the fields of biology and medicine. Since 2006, she has been working on imaging genomics, a research field that links genetic mutations to brain alterations in various psychiatric disorders. Her research focuses on multivariate, multimodal data mining, machine learning method development, and the implementation of such methods on genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, brain MRI images, and electronencephalogram signals for psychiatric and psychological disorders. Examples of her research projects include (1) modeling developmental trajectories of cognition with the interplay of brain imaging, genetics, and epigenetics; (2) predicting the persistence of ADHD using genetics and brain imaging; (3) using imaging genomics to predict Alzheimers disease; and (4) investigating DNA methylation linked genetic risks to brain and behavior in schizophrenia.
