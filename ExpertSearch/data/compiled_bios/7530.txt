Slater Professor, Aeronautics & Astronautics Peraire joined MIT in 1993 as an associate professor after earning undergraduate and graduate engineering degrees from the University of Barcelona in 1983 and 1987, and his PhD and DSc from the University of Wales in 1986 and 1997. He was named a full professor in 1999. Peraires research interests include computational aerodynamicshe is also the director of the Aerospace Computational Design Labas well as simulation-based design and numerical analysis. His work has applications in the areas of computational compressible-fluid dynamics and other multidisciplinary problems in aeronautics. Several software products based on Peraires researchin particular, the FELISA suite of codesare used throughout the aerospace industry. In 1988, Peraire received the Young Researcher Award in Computational Mechanics given by the International Association in Computational Mechanics (IACM); in 1997, he received a NASA Exceptional Achievement Award. He is a fellow of the IACM and an honorary professor in the School of Engineering at the University of Wales, Swansea.
