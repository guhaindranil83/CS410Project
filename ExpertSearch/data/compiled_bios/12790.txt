Some of my work examines how people make selective choices about who to cooperate with and who not to. I also study the reverse of this: how people detect and respond to being ostracized or excluded. Throughout my work, I focus on the underlying emotional processes. I use a variety of methods, including experimental economics games, decision making tasks, social cognition measures, priming methods, and hormonal assays.
