This research goal is achieved by leveraging novel computing paradigms including in-memory, in-sensor, and neuromorphic computing. Capsule Bio:Mingu Kang joined the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California San Diego in 2020 as an Assistant Professor. He received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign (UIUC), Urbana, IL, USA, in 2017. Prior to joining UCSD, he was with IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA, where he worked for machine learning accelerator architectures from 2017 to 2020. He was also with the Memory Division, Samsung Electronics, Hwaseong, South Korea, where he was involved in the circuit and architecture design of phase-change memory from 2009 to 2012.
