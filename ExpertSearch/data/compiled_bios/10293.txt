Dr Lais recent projects include: Work with Mayo Clinic Neurosurgery Physician to apply A.I. and to helpsevere spinal cord injury patients rehab during COVID-19 pandemic. Apply A.I. and machine vision to identify organs and predict morphological changes in fish embryos that were exposed to different chemicals Apply A.I. to learn from more than 16-million medical journal papers and predict chain effects in life science (i.e. from chemicals to cells to tissues to diseases), see details at https://sites.google.com/view/aop-international-research/home Apply A.I. to understand input sentences and generate next sentences based on sentence vectors Apply A.I. to predict power generation and equipment health for hydro/wind energy industry Apply machine learning to predict patients brain activities from fMRIs (https://www.stthomas.edu/awsbraincloud/home/) For more details, please visit http://www.linkedin.com/pub/chih-lai-ph-d/3/2b6/193 Industry Work Summary: Before joining the University of St. Thomas, Dr. Lai was a principal software engineer, working on a new aircraft collision avoidance system (ADS-B) which FAA has mandatory installation on most aircraft by 2020. Dr. Lai received three U.S. patents and three European patents, all related to aircraft collision avoidance algorithms. Dr. Lai also worked with Medtronic and has pending patents on monitoring and evaluating Parkinson patients. Other industry experience includes predicting power generation and equipment health for hydro/wind energy industry.
