He is currently investigating the viability of truth-conditional semantics for natural language, working on a broadly quantificational account of generics. This project raises questions in adjacent areas, especially the philosophy of science: what is a natural kind? What is the connection between explanation and generality? Hopefully, these areas will illuminate each other. He is also interested in debates in the philosophy of mind, especially the nature of representation.He joined the department in 2006 after receiving his Ph.D. from MIT in 2005. Some of his papers are available on his website.
