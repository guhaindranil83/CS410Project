Dale Morgan Professor of Geophysics Associate Director of the Earth Resources Laboratory (ERL) Dale Morgans research interests are in geoelectromagnetics, rock physics, applied seismology, inverse theory, environmental and engineering geophysics, energy, natural cave systems, electronic instrumentation and electrochemistry. Morgan obtained his B.Sc. (1970) in Mathematics and Physics and his M.Sc. (1972) in Theoretical Solid State Physics, both from the University of the West Indies (UWI), Trinidad. He was a lecturer in Physics at UWI Trinidad from 1970 to 1975. From 1975 to 1980 he completed his Ph.D. in Geophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then returned to UWI Trinidad and was attached to the Seismic Research Unit. From 1983 to 1985 he was at Stanford University and from 1985 to 1993 at Texas A&M University. He joined the faculty in 1993.
