Faculty Retention and Success through Intergroup Dialogue and Inclusion Alliance (FIDIA) began as a three-year Provost funded education, dialogue, and research initiative to engage faculty in promoting positive transformative change. The Alliance is composed of faculty members from across the Purdue campus. Please contact Klod Kokini at kokini@purdue.edu with questions. Introduction In alignment with the Office of the Provosts mission to develop creative approaches to foster a culture that supports and sustains innovation, a faculty-centered culture transformation initiative was started in July 2017: Faculty Retention and Success through Intergroup Dialogue and Inclusion Alliance. Our goal is to improve the climate for inclusion at Purdue, thus increasingthe retention, success, and well-being of allfaculty, especially faculty from underrepresented backgrounds (e.g.racial-ethnic minorities and women). Objectives With the vision of facilitating a transformative culture change across campus, the objectives of the Faculty Retention and Success through Intergroup Dialogue and Inclusion Alliance are: promote awareness of inequity, biases, and social justice issues from a range of disciplinary backgrounds; provide evidence-based strategies for promoting inclusion and belonging; prepare faculty (at a predominately white institution and predominately male STEM discipline representation) to succeed in increasing diversity and inclusion on campus; foster collegiality and interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty; and conduct continued research on the experiences of underrepresented groups of faculty (including women in several disciplines and faculty of color) on campus, ways to improve campus culture, and rigorous evaluation of the proposed core activities Core Activities Core activities of our initiative are informed by social science theory, evidence-based approaches to transforming academic culture, and successful efforts at peer institutions. The philosophy of this alliance is to advance faculty members understanding of and respect for diversity and inclusion and to augment skills in the area of intergroup relationships, managing conflict, and promoting inclusion. We are engaging three core activities to transform our campus culture: Educational Opportunities Targeted to Various Levels of Faculty Intergroup Dialogue Research 1. Educational Opportunities Targeted to Various Levels of Faculty One of our core activities is to develop diversity, inclusion, and equity educational opportunities (e.g., workshops, seminars) for faculty based on their starting level of knowledge and designed to build from that level. 2. Intergroup Dialogue Our second core activity involves in-person facilitated intergroup dialogue, where small group offaculty and/or department leaders will come together to explore social group identity, conflict, and social justice. 3. Research All core activities of the Faculty Intergroup Dialogue and Inclusion Alliance will undergo rigorous evaluation research to assess outcomes and aims regarding faculty members gains from diversity and inclusion educational opportunities and intergroup dialogue. References Upcoming Events The core activities of our project are to provide education, to create opportunities for dialogue and to perform research in order to understand how effective our interventions are. The following is a description of our ongoing and planned activities. If you are interested in learning more about any of our activities, please contact Klod Kokini at kokini@purdue.edu. 1. Individual Diversity Plans: Faculty Promoting Positive Change Workshop Series We offer a 3-part educational workshop for faculty designed to raise cultural awareness, foster community and increase a sense of agency to affect change. Each participant is asked to work on a simple project of interest to them and they are encouraged in their own personal project to positively impact inclusion and climate. 2. Be a Better Ally: What we say at Purdue and Why it Matters Workshop This two-hour session, is designed to increase participants awareness of microaggressions, to understand the difference between diversity and inclusion, to provide opportunities to practice using inclusive language, and to participate in scenarios to practice being an intervening ally. 3. A Dialogue with Heads on Inclusion We have designed a dialogue session which considers Purdue related information such as COACHE data, experiences of students and faculty at Purdue, and news items that reflect experiences of faculty and students. 4. How to Have Difficult Conversations Existing evidence shows that communication among faculty is difficult when the topics are complex and uncomfortable. Such topics could include race, gender, privilege, LGBTQ status, etc.Thisdialogue event providesa combined training and practice session on how to have difficult conversationsamong faculty on issues such as racism, sexism, etc. Alliance Team Members Purdue University - College of Education Aye ifti Associate Professor of Counseling Psychology and Educational Studies Ankita Nikalje Doctoral Student, Department of Educational Studies Alberto Rodriguez Mary Endres Chair of Elementary Education, Professor of Science Education Brittany Wright Doctoral Student, Department of Educational Studies Purdue University - College of Engineering Allison Godwin Assistant Professor of Engineering Education Kathleen Howell Associate Dean of Engineering and Hsu Lo Distinguished Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Klod Kokini Professor of Mechanical Engineering Kayla Maxey DoctoralStudent,School of Engineering Education Amy Moors Assistant Professor of Psychology at Chapman Univ.
