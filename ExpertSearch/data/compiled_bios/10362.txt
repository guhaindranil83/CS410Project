Professor Hepplers research interests include the dynamics of structures, and multilink and single link systems. He is pursuing several research projects that involve the dynamics and control of a wide range of flexible structures. These structures range from flexible robotic manipulators, to bridges, and to structures with significant gyroscopic elements. The study of structurally flexible robotic arms is also being pursued by Professor Heppler in the context of dynamic mass capture. Dynamic mass capture is the acquisition of a payload by the robot when there is a significant nonzero relative velocity between the robot end effector and the payload. Both the modelling of the dynamics of this class of systems and the control of the system behaviour is being examined in his research. Additionally, Professor Heppler has several publications on subjects such as natural frequencies and large-stroke electrostatic micro-actuators.Research Interestsdynamics and control of structuresstructural dynamicsmodeling & simulationflexible robot dynamics and controldynamics of multibody and mechatronic systemsmultilink and single link systemsEducation1985, Doctorate, Aerospace, University of Toronto, Institute for Aerospace Studies1979, Master's, Aerospace, University of Toronto, Institute for Aerospace Studies1977, Bachelor's, Engineering Science (Aerospace), University of TorontoCourses*SYDE 352 - Introduction to Control SystemsTaught in 2016SYDE 182 - Physics 2 (Dynamics)Taught in 2016SYDE 181 - Physics 1 (Statics)Taught in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019SYDE 750 - Topics in Systems ModellingTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019BME 399 - Directed Biomedical Research ProjectTaught in 2019SYDE 553 - Advanced DynamicsTaught in 2017, 2018, 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsHassanpour, Soroosh and Heppler, GR, Dynamics of 3D Timoshenko gyroelastic beams with large attitude changes for the gyros, Acta Astronautica, 118, 2016, 33 - 48Hassanpour, Soroosh and Heppler, GR, Theory of micropolar gyroelastic continua, Acta Mechanica, 227(5), 2016, 1469 - 1491Lajimi, SAM and Heppler, GR and Abdel-Rahman, EM, A mechanical--thermal noise analysis of a nonlinear microgyroscope, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 2016Hassanpour, Soroosh and Heppler, GR, Comprehensive and easy-to-use torsion and bending theories for micropolar beams, International Journal of Mechanical Sciences, 114, 2016, 71 - 87Hassanpour, Soroosh and Heppler, GR, Approximation of Infinitesimal Rotations in Calculus of Variations, Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, 39(1), 2016, 705 - 712 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 5 (E5), 6th Floor Phone:519-888-4567 ext.32600 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Systems Design Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
