Prior to joining MIT, he was with AT&T Research Laboratories for five years and with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for seven years. His research encompasses fundamental theories, algorithm design, and experimentation for a broad range of real-world problems. His current research topics include network localization and navigation, network interference exploitation, intrinsic wireless secrecy, adaptive diversity techniques, ultra-wide bandwidth systems, optical transmission systems, and space communication systems. Professor Win was honored with two IEEE Technical Field Awards: the IEEE Kiyo Tomiyasu Award and the IEEE Eric E. Sumner Award. He received the Copernicus Fellowship, the Royal Academy of Engineering Distinguished Visiting Fellowship, the Fulbright Fellowship, the International Prize for Communications Cristoforo Colombo, theLaurea Honoris Causafrom the University of Ferrara, the Technical Recognition Award of the IEEE ComSoc Radio Communications Committee, and the U.S. Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. He is elected Fellow of the AAAS, the IEEE, and the IET, and served as an IEEE Distinguished Lecturer. Professor Win was an elected Member-at-Large on the IEEE Communications Society Board of Governors (2011-2013). He was the Chair (2004-2006) and Secretary (2002-2004) for the Radio Communications Committee of the IEEE Communications Society. He is currently an Editor-at-Large for the IEEE Wireless Communications Letters. He served as Editor (20062012) for the IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, and served as Area Editor (2003-2006) and Editor (1998-2006) for the IEEE Transactions on Communications.
