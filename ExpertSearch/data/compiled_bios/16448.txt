I am also part of the Rigorous Systems Engineering (RSE) research group at KTH. I obtained my PHD degree in Computer Scienceat the Mlardalen University (MDH), Sweden, in June 2019. The title of my PhD thesis is "Automated Approaches for Formal Verification of Embedded Systems Artifacts". For the comprehensive summary ofthe thesis, usethe followinglink. Here is a link to my personal page at MDH, where among other informationyou can find the complete list of my publications during my PhD studies. Research Interests My main area of interest is the formal verificationof complexsoftware systems, by means of both model checking and deductive verification. I am especially interested in the application of the formal verification techniquesonsafety critical industrial embedded software and its models. During the past 6 years, I have had an active collaboration with industrial partners including Scania AB CV (still on-going) and Volvo GTT (finished). If you are a bachelor or master studentand you are interested in writing your thesis in one of the research areas listed above, please do not hesitate to contact me either through email or drop-by my office. I am also trying to always propose some MSc thesis projects that are connected to my ongoing research. Available MSc thesis projects: "Formal Verification of Simulink Models Using Bounded Model Checking*" - for more details check KTH Ad. "Designing and Developing Matlab Simulink Plugin for SYMC*" - for more details check KTH Ad. Or any other idea of yours in the area of formal systems specification or formal verification (model checking, SAT/SMT solving, theorem proving) Note: The theses marked with "*" are intended to becarried out in collaboration with Scania, meaning that the involved students will be working in Scania premises, gaining valuable knowledge and developing their personal network. All students involved in industrial thesis project will be financially compensated by the company.
