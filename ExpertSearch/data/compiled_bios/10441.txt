Sing is Assistant Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. Dr. Sings background is in charged polymers, polymer dynamics, and biophysics. His research group seeks to use coarse-grained models to understand the emergent physics of polymer or biophysical systems, and then use the resulting insights to guide the design new materials. Current research efforts are focused on problems that are challenging because they span large length and time scales, and new theory or simulation methods are necessary to yield new fundamental physical principles. Dr. Sing has been recognized with a number of honors, including the Forbes 30 under 30 in Science in 2015 and MITs DMSE Best PhD Thesis Award. He received his BSE/MS from Case Western Reserve University and his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Sings postdoctoral work was at Northwestern Universitys International Institute for Nanotechnology. He joined the department in 2014. Research Statement Our research aims to use a combination of theory and computer simulation to understand the physical properties of polymeric materials. We use a diverse array of tools with a focus on statistical mechanics and coarse-grained modeling. Biologically-inspired Theory for Polymer Design An abundance of biological materials such as mucin, von Willebrand Factor, and chromatin are known to display interesting physics on disparate time and length scales. We aspire to articulate these physical behaviors found in biological systems and subsequently use our theoretical insight to develop designed molecular systems with novel properties. Specifically, we are pursuing investigations into elasticity and electrostatics in protein-protein interactions and DNA-protein binding, and the subsequent application of these effects to designed materials that exhibit molecular biomimetic properties such as artificial allostery and ion-specific stimuli response. Driven Polymer Conformations Polymer structure and morphology have a rich array of tunable behavior. Tools such as precise chemistry and physical intuition have guided the manipulation of these materials to new levels of complexity. Likewise, advances in kinetically-driven systems using flows and fields provide an orthogonal way to tune systems. We desire further advances in dictating the behavior of materials desired for applications such as molecular organic electronics and patterned substrates, and understanding the kinetic evolution of complex polymer systems. Our research is investigating possibilities that judicious and minimal sequence design coupled with driving fields and flows may provide greater ability to explore the conformational and structural aspects of polymeric systems. New theoretical and conceptual understandings that specifically take into account polymer structure and chemistry will allow the manipulation of polymers due to the interplay between macroscopic controls and molecular-level features. Charged Polymer Materials We are interested in a variety of charged polymer materials, including complex coacervates, polymers in ionic liquids, and melt polyelectrolytes. In particular, we are using a combination of simulation and theory to address challenges such as how effects such as charge correlations, molecular shape, polymer monomer sequence, high charge densities, and chain architecture dictate macroscopic material properties. Our work aspires to reveal new ways to manipulate and tune materials using charges. We are pioneering new ways to use polymers and charges to develop materials capable of emulating biology and relevant to applications ranging from advanced stimuli-responsive systems to materials for energy applications.
