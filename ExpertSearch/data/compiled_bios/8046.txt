Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London, UK Ecole Polytechnique Diploma, FranceResearch InterestsVictor Lefvre is interested in highly-deformable heterogeneous materials and the wide range of mechanical and physical properties they exhibit. His research focuses on the development of analytical and computational tools aimed at describing and predicting the macroscopic multi-physics behavior of these materials from their microscopic characteristics. Thanks to their capability to undergo very large deformations in response to a wide range of external stimuli (including, for instance, mechanical, electric, magnetic, or chemical stimuli), these soft smart materials hold tremendous potential for practical uses in new high-end technologies in significant fields such as robotics and medicine.Significant RecognitionHaythornthwaite Research Initiation Award, ASME AMD, 2018Hibbitt Engineering Postdoctoral Fellowship, School of Engineering, Brown University, 2017Selected PublicationsLefvre, V., Danas, K., Lopez-Pamies, O. 2017.
