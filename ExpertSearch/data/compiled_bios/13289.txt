He earned his PhD in statistics at the University of California, Berkeley, and his BS in mathematics and MS in electrical engineering from Stanford University. He is interested in the interplay between theory and experiment in the natural and mathematical sciences. His current research focuses on ontogenetic stochastic processes in developmental biology and cellular reprogramming. Currently, he is working with Eric Lander, Aviv Regev, and Philippe Rigollet to develop a mathematical model of development based on optimal transport, study its theoretical properties, and use the model to study the dynamics of gene regulation. In his spare time, he likes to go kite boarding!
