Professor Lewis's research has included combining finite elements with other methods for the solution of the Boltzmann equation for neutron transport problems in six-dimensional space-angle-energy phase space. Applications are primarily to the simulation of neutron transport in nuclear reactor cores. His current investigations are focused on neutron transport methods for treating the complex interactions between fuel-coolant lattice structures and more global effects in large power reactor cores. Under investigation are hybrid finite element and finite subelement formulations for treating spatial variables, tailored spherical harmonic expansions in angle, and preconditioned Krylov algorithms for the solution response matrix methods on parallel computers. A second area of interest is reliability and risk assessment, focusing on how it relates to the engineering design process and particularly on the complex relationships between how technical experts and the public perceive the risks that accompany modern technology.Selected PublicationsYunzhao Li, E.
