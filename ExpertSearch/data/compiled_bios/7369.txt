A second line of inquiry is probing the biological and evolutionary underpinnings of human language, including models of language change as well as its biologically-grounded evolutionary origins, in particular, in birdsong. Prof. Berwick has been the recipient of a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Award as well as the MIT Edgerton Faculty Achievement Award, MITs highest honor for junior faculty. He has also received an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award. He helped found and run MITs Center for Biological and Computational Learning for more than 15 years.
