Before coming to Duke, he was a Senior Member of the Technical Staff in the Computer Science Research Institute at Sandia National Laboratories (Albuquerque, NM). Dr. Scovazzis research interests include finite element and advanced numerical methods for computational fluid and solid mechanics. His research emphasizes accurate computational methods aimed at reducing the overall design/analysis costs in multiphase porous media flows, highly transient compressible and incompressible flows, turbulent flows, complex geometry systems in solid mechanics, and fluid/structure interaction problems.
