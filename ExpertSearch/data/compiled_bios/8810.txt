The University of Kentucky is one of only eight universities in the country with a majormedical center featuring six health sciences colleges and the full spectrum of academic colleges on one continuous campus. The close proximity of such a large range of programs is an incubator for inter- and transdisciplinary initiatives. Discoveries from these collaborations allow our researchers to address the needs of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, our nation and our world. 43 Faculty with National Fellowships 200+Industry Partnerships $107MTotal active research awards Metals and Alloys Brazing Aluminum Alloys in Space with Dusan Sekulic Since 2017, Dusan P. Sekulic, Secat J. G. Morris Aluminum Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, has been leading an estimated $1 million international research project funded by NASA and the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities in Russia. Networking Reimagining the Internet on Global Scale A new $3 million grant from theNational Science Foundation(NSF) will expandFABRIC, a project to build the nations largest cyberinfrastructure testbed, to four distinguished scientific institutions in Asia and Europe.Jim Griffioen, a professor in the Department of Computer Scienceis a co-principal investigator on the NSF project. Environmental Engineering and Water Resources Advancing Wastewater Testing to Track COVID-19 Faculty members Scott Berry and Shakira Hobbsare testing a new technology to evaluate wastewater to track community presence of COVID-19. Biosystems and Biomaterials Studying Sulfur Variability in Biofuel Feedstocks with Jian Shi Through a grant from the U.S. Department of Energys Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the research team led by Jian Shi, an assistant professor in the UK College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, will work to identify the reasons behind the sulfur variability in pine feedstocks by studying byproducts collected from across the nation.With the DOE grant and cost-share dollars from universities and the industry, the project will total more than $2 million. Engineering Better Mental Health Solutions with Sarah Wilson Engineers are often tasked with solving complex problems, and one of their most important tools in finding a solution is their own creativity. Ingenuity thats exactly whatSarah Wilsonwould need when confronted with a public health issue in her field. Medical Imaging Guoqiang Yu's Novel Noncontact Imaging Device Could Change Healthcare In 2020, his team has been awarded four grants from the National Institutes of Health that total nearly $5.7 million. Microfluidics Developing a Mask that Captures and Deactivates COVID-19 with Dibakar Bhattacharyya University of Kentucky engineering professor Dibakar Bhattacharyyarecently announcedhe had the concept and the means to develop a medical face mask that would capture and deactivate COVID-19 on contact. Now, the director of UKsCenter of Membrane Sciences, along with collaborators from two different disciplines, has received a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to make these masks a reality. Software Engineering Software Engineering with Tingting Yu In August 2019, computer science assistant professor Tingting Yu received a three-year grant from the National Science Foundation in the amount of approximately $500,000. The project involves collaboration between University of Kentucky and Stevens Institute of Technology, and the goal is to improve the quality of modern software systems. Yu researches the broad field of software engineering, which largely boils down to creating better software. The goal of her research is to engineer techniques that help developers create more dependable, secure and user-friendly software systems. Nanomaterials Nanobiotechnology with Sheng Tong Associate professor Sheng Tong joined the F. Joseph Halcomb III, M.D., Department of Biomedical Engineering this past fall. Prior to arriving in Lexington, Tong was a research associate professor in the Department of Bioengineering at Rice University. Tongs research synergistically combines nanobiotechnology, drug and gene delivery, and cancer therapy. He is currently focusing on developing genome editing approaches for cancer immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Autonomy, Robotics and Controls Preventing Cattle Loss with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Jesse Hoagg It's a staggering statistic every year nearly 3 million cows in the U.S. die from health problems. And it's costing the cattle industry more than $1 billion. Combating this economic loss starts at the producer level. Ultimately, improved observation of cows in the pasture is proven to reduce herd loss. Sounds simple enough right? But beef cattle spend a significant amount of time outside, which makes constant monitoring problematic. Could eyes in the sky be the answer? Jesse Hoagg, the Donald and Gertrude Lester Professor ofMechanical Engineeringat theUniversity of Kentucky, thinks so.
