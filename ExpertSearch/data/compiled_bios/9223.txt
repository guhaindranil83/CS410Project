Dr. Lu's research focuses on the mechanics and manufacture of flexible, stretchable, and bio-integrated electronics. She is leading an interdisciplinary group of 11 PhD students (4 in Engineering Mechanics, 4 in ECE, 2 in MSE, and 1 in ME) and 1 postdoctoral researcher (ECE) working on four major research areas: mechanics of flexible and stretchable structures, mechanics at bio-electronics interface, 2D materials for imperceptible bioelectronics, and freeform manufacture of soft bioelectronics. Representative work of her group includes cost and time effective cut-and-paste manufacture of electronic-tattoos (e-tattoos), wireless and disposable e-tattoos for the ambulatory recording of electrophysiology, respiration, temperature, hydration, oxygen saturation, etc., graphene based imperceptible and ultra-conformable e-tattoos, adhesion between soft materials and between 2D materials, and so on. Dr. Lu has published more than 60 peer reviewed journal articles (with more than 5600 citations), many of which have appeared in high impact journals such as Science, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Materials, PNAS, Advance Materials, Nano Letters, ACS Nano, and so on. She has 1 issued and 5 pending patents. She has presented more than 60 invited talks at international conferences including MRS, ASME IMECE, SPIE, and peer institutes. Her research has been highlighted by news media such as Nature News, Science Online, NSF Science360 News, MIT Technology Review, CNN News, BBC News, NPR, Smithsonian and so on. She has been honored with the NSF CAREER Award, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) and Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Awards, the MITs Technology Review 35 under 35 Award, the 3M Nontenured Faculty Award, and the NetExplo Digital Tech Grand Prix. Dr. Lu was also highlighted as one of the five great innovators on campus by UT Austin Central Communications.
