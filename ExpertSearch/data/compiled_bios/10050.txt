Electrical Engineering; University of Notre Dame (2008) Areas of Research and Professional Interest statistical signal processing efficient sampling and processing of signals information theory signal processing for radar systems About Andrew Harms Andrew Harms received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) in Electrical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 2008 and the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2013. In the Fall of 2016 he begins a position as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. Previously, he was a post doctoral researcher at Duke University working with Prof. Jeffrey Krolik from 2013 to 2016. He has also spent time at the Air Force Research Labs (AFRL) working on non-linear estimation problems and at AT&T Labs working on detection of wireless television signals. His research interests include statistical signal processing, efficient sampling and processing of signals, information theory, and signal processing for radar systems.
