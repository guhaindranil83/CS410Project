His approach combines theory and numerical modeling, field and remote sensing observations, analysis of data from planetary missions, and laboratory experiments. His groups research is organized around three themes: explaining prominent landscape patterns such as branching river networks; using natural experiments to study how climate shapes landscapes; and examining planetary landforms to learn about the evolution of other worlds. Perron holds an AB in Geology and Archaeology from Harvard University and a PhD in Earth and Planetary Science from the University of California, Berkeley. He joined the EAPS faculty in 2009.
