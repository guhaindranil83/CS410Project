Jenkins Predoctoral Fellowship 2004 NSF-IGERT Predoctoral Fellowship in Biotechnology 2000 Presidential Scholarship, Carnegie Mellon University Research Description:The O'Malley Labworks at the interface of engineering and biology to engineer microbes and consortia with novel functions. We are especially interested in deciphering how unwieldy microbes in the environment perform extraordinary tasks - many of these microbes have no available genomic sequence and are exceptionally difficult to manipulate. We seek a betterunderstanding of how proteins are synthesized by cells, and how their three-dimensional structure informs their function would enhance our ability to engineer proteins (and cellular expression platforms) for diverse biomedical and biotechnology applications. To address these issues, our approach combines classical cell biology tools with cutting-edge technologies (genome sequencing, RNAseq, cellular reprogramming) that are rooted in the core biological sciences to interrogate and engineer molecular mechanisms that underlie protein production in eukaryotic cells. In addition, we rely on biophysical methods to elucidate protein-protein contacts, with the aim of controlling these interactions both in vivo and in vitro. Systems of interest to us have broad applicability to bioenergy and sustainability, as well as to drug development and detection. Areas of interest: Genetic and cellular engineering of anaerobic gut fungi Synthetic anaerobic consortia for bioproduction and model development Engineering synthetic fungal cellulosomes and novel biocatalysts Membrane proteins for drug discovery, detection, and diagnostics New membrane proteins for synthetic biology Education:BS: Chemical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University (2004) BS: Biomedical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University (2004) PhD: Chemical Engineering, University of Delaware (2009) Related News October 21, 2020 UCSB to Participate in New Manufacturing Institute Funded by Department of Defense July 30, 2020 Michelle O'Malley Receives Inaugural Early Career Award from AIChE's FPBE Division April 6, 2020 ChE Professor Michelle O'Malley Elected AIMBE Fellow October 10, 2019 Connie Frank Fellowship Awarded to ChE Grad Student Candice Swift more People DirectoryFacultyAdjunct FacultyResearch FacultyEmeritiStaffVisiting ScholarsPostdocsGraduate Students Department ofCHEMICALENGINEERING Engineering II Building University of California, Santa Barbara Santa Barbara, CA 93106-5080 805.893.3412 UCSB Chemical Engineering Facebook UCSB Chemical Engineering Twitter Directory Giving Undergraduate Program Graduate Program Privacy Terms of Use Web Design Feedback Web Content Feedback Copyright 2020The Regents of the University of California, All Rights Reserved.
