The purpose of this endeavor is to characterize biodiversity, and to identify natural areas of endemism that require conservation. Research FocusI have taxonomially revised the native predatory carabid beetles of the Society and Hawaiian Islands. The carabid fauna is quite rich; e.g. 108 species known from the Society Islands and over 400 species known from the Hawaiian Islands . This diversity is distributed so that closely related species are found in restricted geographic ranges on and in adjacent ridges and valleys. In addition, I participated in field work that resulted in discovery of 7 new native species on the island of Moorea, demonstrating that the Society Island fauna occurred on multiple islands just like the fauna in Hawaii. By producing taxonomic identification aids accessible to biologists, the immense biodiversity can be used to identify different areas of endemism, i.e., areas of unique biodiversity that merit conservation efforts.Outreach and Extension FocusThe results of my taxonomic research are immediately applicable to conservation planning in Hawaii and Tahiti. Species distributions of native insects are contributing criteria for location of nature reserves. The Natural Area Reserve System managed by the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources is based on distributions of native organisms; insects, snails and plants chief among them. Information on these native taxa has been incorporated into a Statewide Strategic Plan for native biodiversity. As functioning natural areas form the watersheds of Hawaii, all residents and visitors to the State benefit from this work. Establishment of a Kaluanui Natural Area Reserve in the Koolau Mountain Range of Oahu is one recent measure of success for this work. Here at home, the Cornell University Insect Collection regularly runs tours and develops interactive exercises for Cornell classes as part of our outreach function.Teaching FocusTEACHING (15%): Maggots, Grubs and Cutworms: Larval Insect Biology (spring of even years; 3 cr. with lab, ENTOM 3330). This course successfully integrates the anatomy and biology of holometabolous larvae, evaluating this information in a phylogenetic context. Students leave the course able to attempt larval identifications with all the currently available tools, while gaining access to the incredible amount of biological information available in the larval stages.Additional LinksDepartment Awards and HonorsBest Paper Award for 2009, for" Native and alien Carabidae (Coleoptera) share Lanai, an ecologically devastated island.
