Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Research Teaching and supervision Publications Grants and funding Contact Profile Biography I hold a PhD in Computer Science, which I obtained from the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex. I also hold an MSc in Computer Studies, also from the University of Essex, and a BSc in Economic Sciences, from the Department of Economic Sciences from the University of Athens, Greece. Prior appointments before coming to Essex as a Lecturer include a lectureship at the School of Computing at the University of Kent, Research Assistant positions at CSEE in Essex, and research visits to AI-Econ Center, Department of Economics, at National Cheng Chi University of Taiwan. My research focuses on the use of Machine Learning to Business applications, particularly to Finance and Economics. If you are interested in it, please feel free to have a look on my personal website http://kampouridis.net, where I briefly describe my work so far and my future plans. Also, my publications can give you a more detailed idea of the work I have done until now. Outside the University of Essex, I am a senior member of the IEEE, and a member IEEE Computational Intelligence Society. I am also the Chair of the IEEE Computational Finance and Economics Technical Committee, and a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.
