By understanding how and why molecules assemble, flow, move and react together, it is possible to create, design and control a world of things. Research Interests macromolecular design and synthesis, targeted drug delivery for cancer, nanoscale assembly of synthetic biomaterials, electrostatic and directed materials assembly Education Ph.D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1993 M.S., Georgia Institute of Technology, 1988 S.B., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1984 Publications Honors and Awards MRS Turnbull Lectureship Award from the Materials Research Society, 2019 AIChEs Margaret H.
