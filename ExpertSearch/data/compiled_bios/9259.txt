Starr Career Development Chair Website Matej has a B.Sc. in Geology and a M.Sc. in Structural Geology from the Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. During his master studies, he spent a year at the Universit Montpellier II in France as an ERASMUS scholar. He then pursued a Ph.D. in rock mechanics under the supervision of Prof. Rene Heilbronner and Prof. Holger Stnitz at the Universitt Basel in Switzerland, where he graduated summa cum laude in 2012. After his Ph.D., he joined the laboratory of Prof. David L. Kohlstedt at the University of Minnesota as a postdoctoral researcher. In January 2017 he has joined the MIT EAPS faculty. Research Matej Pec studies the mechanical and microstructural response of rocks to various driving forces associated with plate tectonic movements. To this end, he performs high-pressure, high-temperature experiments in the laboratory and compares the results to natural observations and theoretical models. His work so far has focused on elucidating the processes occurring at the base of the seismogenic layer where brittle and viscous deformation mechanisms act together to accommodate strain. Further, he studies melt migration in partially molten rocks and the processes that lead to magma emplacement along mid-ocean ridges. He is particularly interested in the influence of melt rock reactions and stress on melt migration in the upper mantle. Publications Pe, M., Stnitz, H., Heilbronner, R. and Drury, M.R.
