He earned Dipl.-Ing. (1995) and Magisters (1999) degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Belgrade, Serbia and a doctoral degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (2004) from Instituto Superior Tecnico, Lisbon, Portugal. From 1995 to 2000 he worked as a research engineer in the Automation and Control Division of Mihajlo Pupin Institute, Belgrade, Serbia, on various industry projects before continuing his graduate education. In 2006, Dr. Milutinovis PhD thesis was voted for the first runner-up for the best PhD thesis of European Robotics in 2004 by EURON, the network of over 150 European robotics research groups. He won the National Research Council Award of the US academies in 2008. He held postdoctoral fellow positions in immunology for four years, followed by one year in the area of robotics at Utrecht University, the Netherlands, and Duke University, NC. Dr. Milutinovi pursues research in the area of modeling and control of stochastic dynamical systems applied to robotics. He co-organized the workshop Redundancy in Robot Manipulators and Multi-robot Systems at the 2011 International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) and invited sessions Stochastic Models, Control, and Algorithms in Robotics at the 2012 Dynamical Systems Control Conference (DSCC) and the 2013 American Control Conference (ACC). At the 2013 DSCC, he held the tutorial session Stochastic Processes, Kalman Filtering and Stochastic Control. He is the first author of the research monograph Cells and Robots, Springer, 2007, and the co-editor of the volume Redundancy in Robot Manipulators and Multi-Robot Systems, Springer, 2013. He serves as an Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) and for Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems, Springer. For more details, see Personal Web Page.
