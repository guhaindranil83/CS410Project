Most of my research is aimed at enhancing the conservation of wildlife in fragmented landscapes, through improved ecological understanding. I have specialised in examining behavioural ecology using latest-technology devices such as proximity loggers, custom-made GPS units and sound recorders. I use these devices to complement traditional ecological research techniques (e.g. catch and tag, radio-tracking). I have been a wildlife researcher for the past 15 years working on a wide range of species (mostly mammals), and have coordinated or participated in population monitoring and tracking programs on bandicoots, koalas, native rodents, microbats, rock wallabies, quolls, cassowaries and freshwater turtles, fish and spiny crayfish. My current research focus is aimed at deciphering the koala mating system which, due to their nocturnal and cryptic nature, is poorly understood. Other current research involves examining koala utilisation of rehabilitated habitats, the ability of koalas to cope with climate change scenarios, as well as disease impact and transmission (esp. Chlamydia) in wild koala populations. I have also commenced some research into the ecology of the elusive spotted-tailed quoll, using camera traps and light-weight GPS collars. I have collaborated widely during my research career, mostly with ecologists from other Australian research institutions. This is reflected in the wide scope of published scientific papers I have contributed to.
