His research group, the 2D Materials and Electrochemical Devices Lab, focuses on improving the production and processing of various 2D nanomaterials with the aim of developing higher performance electrochemical devices and composites. Professor Pope has made significant contributions to the understanding of electrochemical mechanisms involving graphene and has developed various self-assembly strategies to process electrodes for improved high voltage graphene-based supercapacitors, Li-S batteries and electrochemical sensors.Research InterestsGraphene Production and Post-processing TechniquesDirected Assembly of 2D Nanomaterials at the Air-Water interfaceBottom-up Assembly Approaches for Energy StorageSensing and ElectrocatalysisConnectivity and Internet of ThingsAdditive ManufacturingNanotechnologyIoTDevicesEducation2013, Doctorate, Chemical Engineering, Princeton University2009, Master of Arts, Chemical Engineering, Princeton University2007, Bachelor of Applied Science, Chemical Engineering & Bioengineering, McMaster UniversityCourses*CHE 331 - Electrochemical EngineeringTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019NE 491 - Nanostructured MaterialsTaught in 2015CHE 755 - Res Topics in Electrochemical Engineering, Interfacial Eng & Material ScienceTaught in 2015, 2016, 2019CHE 715 - Research Topics in Transport PhenomenaTaught in 2017NE 352 - Surfaces and InterfacesTaught in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019NE 499 - Special Topics in Nanostructured MaterialsTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsHawes, Gillian F and Rehman, Sarish and Pope, Michael A, Rapid Prototyping of Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices Based on 2D Materials, Current Opinion in Electrochemistry, 2020Chen, Jialu and Walker, Wesley R and Xu, Luzhu and Krysiak, Olga and She, Zimin and Pope, Michael A, Intrinsic Capacitance of Molybdenum Disulfide, ACS nano, 14(5), 2020, 5636 - 5648Wen, Guobin and Rehman, Sarish and Tranter, Tom G and Ghosh, Debasis and Chen, Zhongwei and Gostick, Jeff T and Pope, Michael A, Insights into multiphase reactions during self-discharge of Li-S batteries, Chemistry of Materials, 2020Xu, Luzhu and Tetreault, Adam R and Pope, Michael A, Chemical Insights into the Rapid, Light-Induced Auto-Oxidation of Molybdenum Disulfide Aqueous Dispersions, Chemistry of Materials, 32(1), 2019, 148 - 156Dosi, Manan and Lau, Irene and Zhuang, Yichen and Simakov, David SA and Fowler, Michael W and Pope, Michael A, Ultrasensitive electrochemical methane sensors based on solid polymer electrolyte-infused laser-induced graphene, ACS applied materials & interfaces, 11(6), 2019, 6166 - 6173Hawes, Gillian F and Yilman, Dilara and Noremberg, Bruno S and Pope, Michael A, Supercapacitors Fabricated via Laser-Induced Carbonization of Biomass-Derived Poly (furfuryl alcohol)/Graphene Oxide Composites, ACS Applied Nano Materials, 2(10), 2019, 6312 - 6324Ghosh, Debasis and Gad, Mariam and Lau, Irene and Pope, Michael A, Trapping and Redistribution of Hydrophobic Sulfur Sols in Graphene--Polyethyleneimine Networks for Stable Li--S Cathodes, Advanced Energy Materials, 8(27), 2018Xu, Luzhu and Tetreault, Adam R and Khaligh, Hadi H and Goldthorpe, Irene A and Wettig, Shawn D and Pope, Michael A, Continuous Langmuir--Blodgett Deposition and Transfer by Controlled Edge-to-Edge Assembly of Floating 2D Materials, Langmuir, 35(1), 2018, 51 - 59 TOP Share University of Waterloo Engineering 6(E6) Phone:519-888-4567 Staff and Faculty DirectoryContact the Department of Chemical Engineering Support Waterloo Engineering Waterloo EngineeringFaculty OpeningsProvide WebsiteFeedback University of Waterloo University of Waterloo 43.471468 -80.544205 200 University Avenue West Waterloo, ON, Canada N2L 3G1 +1 519 888 4567 Contact Waterloo Maps & Directions WatSAFE Accessibility Privacy Copyright Media Careers Feedback @uwaterloo social directory The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land promised to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is centralized within our Indigenous Initiatives Office.
