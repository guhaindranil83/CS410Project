He joined the University of Waterloo in April 2018 as an Assistant Professor in Biomedical Engineering within the Department of Systems Design Engineering. Dr. Haji-Reza received a University of Waterloo Faculty of Engineering Distinguished Performance Award in the first (full) year of his career as a faculty member. Dr. Haji-Reza has authored more than 40 high impact peer-reviewed journal papers in the field of photonics and biomedical optics. He also holds more than 7 patents to date. In the first two years of his research, Dr. Haji-Reza secured more than $2 million dollars in research funding as the principal investigator to support his interdisciplinary research program. Dr. Haji Reza is interested in designing and developing novel hardware and software methods for clinical and pre-clinical biomedical applications. These new technologies aim to provide clinicians and researchers with novel capabilities and information that is presently difficult to obtain with existing techniques. He invented and pioneered several new technologies/concepts including, Photoacoustic Remote Sensing (PARS) microscopy, a novel absorption-based, non-contact, non-invasive, label-free imaging technique. In November 2014, he co-founded a start-up company illumiSonics inc., holding the position of CEO from November 2014 to March 2018. During Dr. Haji Reza's leadership role at illumiSonics, he raised private investments and attracted notable individuals and international companies. He is currently the Chairman of the Board and the chief technology officer of illumiSonics, overseeing the major policies and decisions of this Company. Dr. Haji Reza and his team continually strive to maintain an extremely dynamic, respectful, intellectual, fun, and creative environment. The team is working on cutting-edge research in biomedical engineering and biophotonics, including non-invasive non-contact optical imaging methods, micro-endoscopy designs, handheld, and portable medical imaging techniques, design, and fabrication of nano-structured sensors, image processing, Machine Learning methods, Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers, and novel deep optical imaging tomography methods. The team pursues applications in Ophthalmology, Oncology, Dermatology, Neurology, Cardiology, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical, and Pre-clinical research. The research philosophy of PhotoMedicine labs is transitional research from bench to the bedside. We are always looking to collaborate with talented students, faculties, researchers, clinicians, and industry.Research InterestsMedical imagingImage processingMachine learningMedical devicesNano-fabricationPhotoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) microscopyCapacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT)Multi-scale functional and molecular photoacoustic tomographyUltrasound imagingAll optical and non-contact detection systemsPhotoacoustic wavefront shapingOptical coherence tomography (OCT)Multi-photon microscopyNovel multi-modality optical imaging techniquesDesign and fabrication of micro-endoscopy systemsSuper-resolution imaging techniquesReal-time and 3D biomedical imagingNovel optical and fiber-based componentsNovel laser systems for biomedical applicationsOptical sensorsBiomedical Engineering OpticsPhotonicsEducation2015, Doctorate, Biomedical Engineering, University of Alberta2010, Bachelor's, (Honors) Electronics Majoring in Optical Engineering, Multimedia UniversityCourses*BME 393 - Digital SystemsTaught in 2019BME 302 - SeminarTaught in 2019BME 364 - Engineering Biomedical EconomicsTaught in 2019* Only courses taught in the past 5 years are displayed.Selected/Recent PublicationsBenjamin R.
