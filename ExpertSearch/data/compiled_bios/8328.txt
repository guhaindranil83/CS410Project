PubMed Research Research Overview Michael Worden's research uses neuroimaging (fMRI, EEG) and behavioral techniques to investigate brain processes involved in attention and visual perception. His interests focus on how attention is influenced by the properties of the items to which attention is directed and the specific mechanisms by which the brain is able to select relevant items and suppress other items. He also investigates how attention is influenced by behavior such as recent experience and extensive practice.
