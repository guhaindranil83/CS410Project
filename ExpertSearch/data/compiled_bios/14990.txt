Boadu Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Fred Boadu received his B.S. (Hons) in geological engineering from the University of Science and Technology, Ghana, a Post-Graduate Diploma in applied geophysics from McGill University, an M.S. in geophysics from the University of Calgary, and his Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1994. He was an Assistant Lecturer at the University of Science and Technology, School of Mines (Tarkwa, Ghana) from 1982 to 1984. Since 1986, he has worked for several oil companies (Chevron, Amoco, and Mobil) during the summer months on a variety of research projects. He is also a consultant for Texaco, Inc. and Ghana National Petroleum Corporation. Dr. Boadus research focuses on the areas of exploration, engineering and environmental geophysics. Current research involves characterizing the transport and storage properties of porous media such as fractured rocks, soils and human tissue. The work involves modeling, laboratory and field experiments. Fractal concepts and neural networks are used to interpret results. Recently, Dr. Boadu has been involved in research regarding nitrate contamination in groundwater, and as well, in education and awareness campaign of the implications in potential health hazards in Ghana Appointments and Affiliations Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering Associate Research Professor of Global Health Faculty Network Member of The Energy Initiative Contact Information Office Location: 163 Hudson Hall, Box 90287, Durham, NC 27708 Office Phone: (919) 660-5432 Email Address: boadu@duke.edu Websites: http://applied-geophysics.cee.duke.edu Education Ph.D. Georgia Institute of Technology, 1994 Research Interests How the engineering, environmental and petrophysical properties of porous media (soils, fractured rock, biological tissues) affect measurable geophysical responses, and subsequently develop methodologies by which these properties can be obtained from non-invasive geophysical measurements.
