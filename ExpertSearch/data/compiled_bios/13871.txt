Blum Associate Teaching Professor, Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate Program Director Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering 239 Link Hall 315.443.2840 [emailprotected] Degree: May 2012 Ph.D., Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN Jan. 2011 M.S., Mechanical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN May 2007 B.S., Mechanical Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY May 2007 B.S., Physics, University of New York at Albany, Albany, NY Lab/Center Affiliation: Mechanics and Tribology Laboratory Research Interests: Tribology & Lubrication Mechanical Characterization of Materials Finite Element Analysis Current Research: Dr. Blum specializes in high performance materials development and characterization for tribological (friction and wear), structural, and biomedical applications. Her primary research interests are in the development of orthopedic biomaterials, and biomaterial characterization utilizing a combination of experimental techniques, nanoindentation, and computational modeling. Dr. Blum is also interested in characterizing the tribological performance of biological tissues using soft material contact mechanics and simulation. Understanding the structure-property relationships of biological tissues during contacting motion aids her lab in the development of synthetic biomimetic materials.
