Ludwig Professor for Cancer Research; Associate Department Head; Associate Director, David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research Jacqueline Lees develops mouse and zebrafish models, identifying the molecular pathways leading to tumor formation. 617-252-1972 Phone 76-461 Office jalees@mit.edu Email Lab Website Paul Thompson Assistant 617-258-0480 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1990, University of London BSc, 1986, Biochemistry, University of York Research Summary We identify the proteins and pathways involved in tumorigenicity establishing their mechanism of action in both normal and tumor cells. To do so, we use a combination of molecular and cellular analyses, mutant mouse models and genetic screens in zebrafish.
