The Human Centered Monitoring Laboratory (HCML)at Michigan Technological University was established by Dr. Ye (Sarah) Sun in August 2014. The HCML is an interdisciplinary resort that integrates engineering innovation with human health and human behaviors. Our primary research focus is on human-centered smart monitoring technologies that integrate advanced technology, human factors, and decision support to improve human-centered healthcare. News Multiple Ph.D. openings are available starting from Spring 2020. Please contact Prof. Sun at YES@mtu.edu with a recent resume. Background and interest in PCB design and python/C programming are required.
