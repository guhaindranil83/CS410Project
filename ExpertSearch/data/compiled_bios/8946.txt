Comello, Gunther Glenk, Stefan J. ReichelsteinMay 2020The rapid deployment of electric vehicles is widely viewed as a promising path towards decarbonizing the transportation sector. The pace at which electric vehicles will replacethose with internal combustion engines... Working Paper|The Impact of Carbon Disclosure Mandates on Emissions and Financial Operating Performance Benedikt Downar, Jurgen Ernstberger, Stefan J. Reichelstein, Sebastian Schwenen, Aleksandar ZaklanMay 2020We examine whether a disclosure mandate for greenhouse gas emissions creates stakeholder pressure for firms to subsequently reduce their emissions. For UK-incorporated listed firms such a mandate was adopted in... Journal Article|Synergistic Value in Vertically Integrated PowertoGas Energy Systems Gunther Glenk, Stefan J. ReichelsteinProduction and Operations Management. October 2019In vertically integrated energy systems, integration frequently entails operational gains that must be traded off against the requisite cost of capacity investments. In the context of the model analyzed in... Journal Article|The Emergence of Cost Effective Battery Storage Stephen D. Comello, Stefan J. ReichelsteinNature Communications. May 2019, Vol. 10, Issue 1, Pages 2038Energy storage will be key to overcoming the intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources. Here, we propose a metric for the cost of energy storage and for identifying optimally... Journal Article|Economics of Converting Renewable Power to Hydrogen Stefan J. Reichelstein, Gunther GlenkNature Energy. February 25 , 2019, Vol. 4, Pages 216-222The recent sharp decline in the cost of renewable energy suggests that the production of hydrogen from renewable power through a power-to-gas process might become more economical. Here we examine... Journal Article|The Road Ahead for Solar PV Power Stephen D. Comello, Stefan J. Reichelstein, Anshuman SahooRenewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews. September 2018, Vol. 92, Pages 744-756Over the past decade, solar photovoltaic (PV) power has experienced dramatic deployment growth coupled with substantial decreases in system prices. This article examines how solar PV power is currently positioned... Working Paper|The Emergence of Cost Effective Battery Storage Stephen D. Comello, Stefan J. ReichelsteinJuly 2018Energy storage will be key to overcoming the intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power. This paper proposes a cost metric for measuring the cost... Journal Article|Managerial Flexibility in Levelized Cost Measures: A Framework for Incorporating Uncertainty in Energy Investment Decisions John E. Bistline, Stephen D. Comello, Anshuman SahooEnergy. May 2018, Vol. 151, Pages 211-225Many irreversible long-run capital investments entail opportunities for managers to respond flexibly to changes in the economic environment. However, common levelized cost measures used to guide decision-making, such as the... Working Paper|Operational Volatility and Synergistic Value in Vertically Integrated Energy Systems Gunther Glenk, Stefan J. ReichelsteinApril 2018We examine the magnitude of synergistic effects in vertically integrated energy systems that arise when the external market for an intermediate input (electricity) is imperfect and the two subsystems are... Working Paper|The Prospects for Renewable Hydrogen Production Gunther Glenk, Stefan J. ReichelsteinDecember 2017Hydrogen has long been heralded as a potentially critical element in the transition to a low carbon economy. The recent sharp cost declines for renewable energy raise the question whether...
