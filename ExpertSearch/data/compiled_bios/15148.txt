Derek Tucker Contact Information101 Illini Hall M/C 374 Champaign, IL 61820 dtucker1@illinois.edu Research AreasFundamental Research in StatisticsData Science and Big Data Analytics Edit Your Profile Adjunct Clinical Associate Professor View CV BiographyI obtained my Ph.D.in Statistics fromFlorida State University. I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees fromColorado State University, Fort Collins, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, both in electrical engineering, with an emphasis on statistical signal processing. My dissertation was advised byAnuj SrivastavaandWei Wu and focused modeling of unaligned functional data. Currently, I am a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, and an adjunct faculty member of the Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois. At Illinois, I teach a topics course on functional data analysis. Recently, I received the Director of National Intelligence Team Award for contributions to the Signal Location in Complex Environments (SLiCE) team. My main interest lies in the area of functional data analysis with a focus on geometric methods and unaligned data. I recently have emphasized on statistical analysis of data of this type. My other research interests include statistical image understanding, statistical learning methods, and point processes.
