Biography Elizabeth Hoiem joined the iSchool faculty as an assistant professor in 2014. She teaches in the areas of children's literature, history of children's literature, reading and literacy, and fantasy literature. In her research and teaching, she explores the history of technological innovations in children's literaturefrom early children's books and toys to contemporary applications of digital pedagogyand looks at modern technology through a historical lens. In addition to literature and the history of literature, Hoiem's research interests include digital humanities pedagogy. Her current book project, The Education of Things: Mechanical Literacies in British Children's Literature, 1760-1860, supported by an NEH fellowship, investigates the class politics of learning with objects. Hoiem uses the term "mechanical literacy"to describe the convergence of alphabetical and manual literacies associated with social mobility in the industrial era. Her award-winning article, "Radical Cross-Writing for Working Children,"locates an overlooked Radical working-class tradition of writing for children, including broadsides, protest songs, prayers for shorter work hours, hat banners, and Radical journalism. Other recent articles explore childrens nonfiction about science and technology. "A Child-Centered Universe"argues that nineteenth-century children's nonfiction was organized according to children's cognitive development and spatial orientation. "The Progress of Sugar"investigates representations of slavery in production stories (a genre that includes David Macaulay's Cathedral and Clara Hollos's The Story of Your Coat (1946)) and asks how these stories inform children about who makes things, under what conditions, and for whom. Hoiem received bachelor's degrees in English and communication design from the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, in 2002. She received an MA in literary and cultural studies from Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 and a PhD in English from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2013. Prior to joining the iSchool faculty, Hoiem was an assistant professor at East Carolina University.
