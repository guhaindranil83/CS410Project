Cheeseman Professor of Biology; Member, Whitehead Institute; Interim Graduate Officer Iain Cheeseman analyzes the process by which cells duplicate, focusing on the molecular machinery that segregates the chromosomes. 617-324-2503 Phone WI-401B Office icheese@wi.mit.edu Email Lab Website Nicholas Polizzi Assistant 617-258-9243 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 2002, University of California, Berkeley BS, 1997, Biology, Duke University Research Summary Our lab analyzes the molecular basis for kinetochore function. We study chromosome segregation during mitosis, which requires the kinetochore to mediate attachments between chromosomal DNA and spindle microtubule polymers. We use a combination of proteomics, biochemistry, cell biology, and functional approaches to examine kinetochore composition, structure, organization and function.
