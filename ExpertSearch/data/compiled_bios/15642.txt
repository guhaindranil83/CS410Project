Koch Professor of Biology; Daniel K. Ludwig Scholar for Cancer Research; Investigator, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Tyler Jacks is interested in the genetic events contributing to the development of cancer, and his group has created a series of mouse strains engineered to carry mutations in genes known to be involved in human cancers. 617-253-0262 Phone 76-453 Office tjacks@mit.edu Email Lab Website Judy Teixeira Assistant 617-253-0263 Assistant Phone Education PhD, 1988, University of California, San Francisco SB, 1983, Biology, Harvard University Research Summary Dr. Jacks research has focused on developing new methods for the construction and characterization of genetically engineered mouse models or GEMMs of human cancer, and recently has moved into the burgeoning area of tumor immunology to understand the interactions between the immune system and cancer. His group has produced GEMMs with constitutive and conditional mutations in several tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and genes involved in oxidative stress, DNA repair and epigenetic control of gene expression. These GEMMS have been used to examine the mechanism of tumor initiation and progression, to uncover the molecular, genetic and biochemical relationship to the human diseases, as tools to study response and resistance to chemotherapy, and to explore methods in molecular imaging and early detection of cancer.
