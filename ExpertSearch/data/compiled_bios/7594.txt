I am a primary contributor to the development and implementation of the fruit program area plan of work that addresses the needs of diverse audience groups, including: the horticultural industry sector (growers, consultants, agricultural industry representatives of crop protection, production, processing, packing/storage, and distribution companies); governmental and regulatory agencies; campus- and field-based Cornell Cooperative Extension agents, specialists, and support staff; academic peers in neighboring states and provinces; and the public sector, including homeowners, community groups, local schools, and other public organizations.Research FocusMy research program is designed to be an integrated part of my overall responsibility through the discovery and interpretation of new information on pest management that has immediate value to my extension audience. Because of the enduring importance of chemical tools in the fruit pest management process, methods and effectiveness of pesticide use constitute one major part of this activity. However, a significant portion of my research effort focuses on evaluating and demonstrating the potential usefulness and application of nonchemical alternatives, such as pheromone mating disruption, conservation biological control, and less toxic protectants derived from non-traditional sources such as microbials, fermentation products, botanicals, and oils.Outreach and Extension FocusIt is my responsibility to provide information on effective, economical, and sustainable methods of managing fruit arthropod pests to all our clientele. Extension efforts involve annually updating university control recommendations according to current research findings, providing diagnostic services for arthropod pests of tree fruit, monitoring the effectiveness of control programs to identify the causes of pest outbreaks, and cooperating with industry in the registration of new products. A second program area is the development and implementation of pest management approaches in tree fruit to maintain quality and production standards while minimizing potential economic and biological problems such as insecticide resistance, secondary pest outbreaks, and natural enemy population decline.Additional LinksScaffolds Fruit Newsletter Professional Tree Fruit Entomology NEWA Apple Insect Prediction Models Solid Set Canopy Delivery System Agnello Lab Awards and HonorsCALS Outstanding Accomplishments in Extension/Outreach (2011) Cornell College of Agriculture and Life SciencesSelected PublicationsJournal PublicationsAgnello, A.
