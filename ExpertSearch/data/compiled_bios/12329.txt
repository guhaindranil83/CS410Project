The motif used to construct supramolecular species is coordination and chelation to form discrete molecular entitites with well defined geometries and shapes. We are particularly interested in the assembly of various polygons and polyhedra. To build these supramolecular species one needs only units that provide the proper angles at the corners and hence shape and appropriate di and tritopic connectors. Illustrative examples are: The ultimate goal of this research is the rapid assembly of nanoscale molecular devices for practical applications such as information storage, artificial photosynthetic devices, etc. Short term interest includes uses in molecular recognition, chiral recognition, host-guest interactions, catalysis, enantoselective catalysis, etc. Selected Key Publications (590 total publications including 7 monographs and 3 dozen reviews) Soft Materials with Diverse Suprastructures vis the Self-Assambly of Metal-Organic Complexes, Y.
