Faculty Lukasz Witek , MSci, Ph.D. Assistant Professor of Biomaterials (New York University College of Dentistry) Biomedical Engineering Dr.Lukasz Witek has been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomaterialsat New York University (NYU) since September 2018. He earned his BSci inBiology at Temple University in 2008 andMSci in Biomaterials Science from NewYork University in 2011. Dr. Witek defended his PhD in Chemical Engineering in2015 at Oklahoma State University under the guidance of Prof. James E. Smay.Uponcompletion of his PhD studies, he re-joined NYUs Department of Biomaterialsas a post-doctoral fellow and Director of Craniomaxillofacial OrthopedicBiomaterials Regenerative Applications Lab, focusing on 3Dprinting forregenerative medicine applications. Dr. Witek has authored/co-authored over 35journal articles, served as guest editor for multiple journals as well servedas chair of the individual sessions atInternational Associate of DentalResearch (IADR) and Society for Biomaterials (SFB). Dr. Witeks primary focusis 3D printing bio-ceramic materials for tissue regeneration. Dr. Witeks labprimarily focuses oninvivoandin vitro,evaluation of a widerange of (bio)materials. In addition to 3D printing, Dr. Witek researchinterest focus on various resorbable and non-resorbable dental materials aswell as titanium implants fordental and orthopedic applications.
