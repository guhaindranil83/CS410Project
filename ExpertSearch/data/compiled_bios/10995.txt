Faculty Yong-Ak (Rafael) Song Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at NYU Abu Dhabi Biomedical Engineering Applied Physics Connect Rafael Songs research and teaching interests are interdisciplinary in both mechanical engineering disciplines such as design and manufacturing of MEMS devices, fluid mechanics, and micro/nanofabrication, as well as in biological engineering areas such as BioMEMS devices for separation and detection of biomolecules, neuroprosthetic implants, and transport phenomena in biological systems. He received his BS, MS, and PhD from RWTH Aachen University, Germany and worked at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) as a Senior Research Scientist. He joined Fraunhofer USA as a Senior Engineer in 2001 and worked in the Micro/Nanofluidic BioMEMS Group in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT as a Research Scientist. Song held an appointment as a Research Fellow at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston until he joined NYUAD in September 2012.
